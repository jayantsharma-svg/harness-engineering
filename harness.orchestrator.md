# Built-in maintenance tasks run on cron when `maintenance.enabled: true`.
# Notable housekeeping tasks: `main-sync` (every 15 min) fast-forwards the
# orchestrator's local default branch from origin so files read from `cwd`
# (e.g., docs/roadmap.md, harness.orchestrator.md) stay current. Sync is
# fast-forward-only — never destructive — and skips with a structured
# warning event if the working tree is dirty, the branch is wrong, or the
# local default has diverged. Disable all maintenance via `maintenance.enabled: false`.
#
# Per-task Run Now (since 2026-05-09): the dashboard Maintenance page renders
# a Run Now button on every row of the schedule table. The previous single-
# button affordance (which always triggered `project-health`) has been
# removed. Each button is disabled while a `maintenance:started` event is in
# flight for that task ID and re-enables on the matching `maintenance:completed`
# or `maintenance:error` event.

# Prompt Template

You are an expert coding agent working on the Harness Engineering project.
Your goal is to implement the following issue using the standard Harness Engineering workflow.

## Issue: {{ issue.title }}

**Identifier:** {{ issue.identifier }}
**Description:** {{ issue.description }}

## Standard Workflow

Follow these steps exactly, using the corresponding slash commands to ensure
high-quality, architecturally sound delivery:

1. **Brainstorming:** Use `/harness:brainstorming` to explore the problem space
   and draft a technical proposal in `docs/changes/`. The spec MUST include an
   Integration Points section defining how the feature connects to the system.
2. **Planning:** Use `/harness:planning` to create a detailed implementation plan.
   The plan MUST include integration tasks derived from the spec's Integration Points.
3. **Execution:** Use `/harness:execution` to implement the changes task-by-task,
   including integration tasks (registrations, ADRs, doc updates).
4. **Verification:** Use `/harness:verification` to ensure the implementation is
   complete, wired correctly, and meets all requirements.
5. **Integration:** Use `/harness:integration` to verify that system wiring,
   knowledge materialization, and documentation updates are complete per the
   integration tier.
6. **Code Review:** Use `/harness:code-review` and `/harness:pre-commit-review`
   to perform a final quality check before completing the task.
   6b. **Compound (when applicable):** Run `/harness:compound` when ANY of these
   three concrete triggers fired during this issue:
   (a) `/harness:debugging` was invoked at any point (regardless of outcome),
   (b) the fix required more than one commit on the issue branch, or
   (c) execution involved >1 attempt (`Attempt Number` above is greater than 1).
   Otherwise skip silently. The triggers are mechanical — no judgment required.
7. **Ship:** When the review is clean, you are pre-authorized to ship without asking:
   - Create a topic branch if you are still on `main`/`master` (e.g. `feat/{{ issue.identifier }}`).
   - Stage your changes and create a descriptive commit (Conventional Commits style).
   - Push the branch with `git push -u origin HEAD`.
   - Open a pull request. Use a HEREDOC for the body to preserve newlines:
     ```
     gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
     ## Summary
     <body content with real newlines>
     EOF
     )"
     ```
     Or use `gh pr create --fill` to auto-generate from commit messages.
   - Report the PR URL as your final output, then stop. Do not await further instructions — this is the terminal step of the workflow.

## Rules

- Always verify your changes with `harness validate`.
- Adhere to the architectural constraints defined in `harness.config.json`.
- For non-trivial learnings, run `/harness:compound` (writes structured docs to
  `docs/solutions/<track>/<category>/`). The `.harness/learnings.md` file remains
  for ephemeral session notes only and is not preserved as compounding knowledge.
- Step 7 (Ship) is part of the standard workflow. Do not pause to ask for commit authorization — completing the issue means the PR has been opened.
