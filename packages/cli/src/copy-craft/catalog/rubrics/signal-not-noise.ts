    'Every log line should be worth scanning at 3am during an incident. Lines like ' +
    '"entered function", "x = 1", "starting", "done" are noise — they fire too often to ' +
    'be useful and crowd out signal. Useful log lines carry state changes, transitions, ' +
    'decisions, or exceptional paths with the data needed to understand them.',
