/**
 * Revert state — persists the most-recent batch of applied codemods to

 * reconstruct the inverse. Single-shot history per v1 spec; multi-step
 * history is v1.x.
 *
 * Each entry records the original DriftFinding + the diff that was
 * written + a SHA-1 of the post-apply file content. The hash lets revert
 * detect "file edited externally since apply" (SC #27).
