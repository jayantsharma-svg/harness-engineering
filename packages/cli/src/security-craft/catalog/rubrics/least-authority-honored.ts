    'Does this code take only the authority it needs, or does it operate with ' +
    'ambient privilege beyond what the task requires? Watch for: admin/service ' +
    'credentials used where a scoped token would do; root-equivalent DB user ' +
    'running queries that need only SELECT on one table; a handler that loads ' +
    'the full user record when only the id is needed downstream; broad scopes ' +
    'requested when narrow would do. Least authority is shape-level, not ' +
    'pattern-matchable — judgment call. Medium confidence covers shapes that ' +
    'suggest over-privilege; high requires a named ambient-privilege use.',
