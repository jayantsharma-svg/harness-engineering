    'A well-structured test has three visually distinct phases: ARRANGE the inputs and ' +
    'preconditions, ACT by exercising the system, ASSERT the outcomes. Interleaving the three ' +
    '(arrange → act → assert → arrange → act → assert) signals either multiple tests merged ' +
    'into one (split them) or a sequence of state mutations being verified inline (extract a ' +
    'helper or use a different assertion style). A single test should answer one question; ' +
    'its structure should reveal that question at a glance.',
