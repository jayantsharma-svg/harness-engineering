  description:
    'Heavy `beforeEach` / factory / shared-fixture setup must be justified by what the test ' +
    'actually verifies. A 47-line `beforeEach` followed by `expect(result).toBeDefined()` is ' +
    'rope-throwing. Setup belongs in a test only if the assertion meaningfully depends on it. ' +
    "If a fixture is reused across many tests, that's reuse-justified; if it serves only this " +
    'test, the per-test work-to-signal ratio should be roughly balanced. Watch for: long setup ' +
    "blocks with trivial assertions; setup that depends on state the assertion doesn't read; " +
    "factory complexity that exceeds the test's documented intent.",
