### Patch Changes

- 8e8e7c1: fix(orchestrator): seed brainstorm handoff artifacts into fresh worktrees

  New worktrees are checked out from a committed remote ref (e.g. `origin/main`),
  so they did not inherit the uncommitted artifacts of the brainstorm →
  orchestrator handoff — the proposal under `.harness/proposals/` and the promoted
  row in `docs/roadmap.md`. A dispatched agent saw the roadmap entry (the tracker
  reads the live working tree) but could not find its proposal and stalled.

  `WorkspaceManager.ensureWorkspace` now seeds those paths from the root working
  tree into each fresh worktree (best-effort: missing sources skipped, copy
  failures swallowed). Seed paths default to `['.harness/proposals',
'docs/roadmap.md']`, are overridable via the new `WorkspaceConfig.seedPaths`,
  and the orchestrator derives the roadmap entry from the configured tracker
  `filePath` so a non-default roadmap location is still carried over.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 5f9ed8c: Scaffolds the Local Model Lifecycle Manager (LMLM) — Phase 0.
  - New package `@harness-engineering/local-models` (empty barrel, no business logic yet).
  - New types in `@harness-engineering/types`: `LocalModelsConfig`, `LocalModelsPoolConfig`, `LocalModelsRefreshConfig`, `LocalModelsInstallerConfig`, `LocalModelsHardwareOverride`, plus platform/installer unions.
  - New optional `localModels` block on `HarnessConfigSchema` in the CLI, with Zod defaults that match the spec (24h refresh, 100GB budget, Ollama installer, opt-in disabled by default).

  Disabled by default; `harness validate` on existing configs remains green. Hardware detection, ranking, pool management, installer, proposal lifecycle, scheduler, HTTP/WS surfaces, CLI commands, and dashboard panel land in subsequent phases per `docs/changes/local-model-lifecycle-manager/proposal.md`.

- 318b878: Add `STRATEGY.md` schema and validator (strategic-anchor phase 1 of 8 in the compound-engineering-adoption initiative).
  - `packages/types` exports `StrategyFrontmatter`, `StrategyDoc`, `StrategySection`, `REQUIRED_STRATEGY_SECTIONS`, `OPTIONAL_STRATEGY_SECTIONS`.
  - `packages/core/strategy` exports `StrategyDocSchema`, `StrategyFrontmatterSchema`, `parseStrategyDoc`, `asStrategyDoc`.
  - `packages/core/validation` exports `validateStrategy(cwd)` consumed by `harness validate`.
  - CLI `harness validate` now reports a `strategyConfig` check: soft-passes when STRATEGY.md is absent; fails with a precise per-section message when present and malformed (missing required section, unfilled template placeholder, malformed frontmatter).

  Scope: schema + validator only. The `harness-strategy` skill, the `harness-ideate` skill, init wiring, brainstorming/roadmap-pilot grounding, knowledge-graph integration, and ADRs ship in follow-up PRs (one per phase, matching the feedback-loops cadence).

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- dcca2ce: Spec B (Granular Task→Backend Routing): per-skill + per-cognitive-mode routing axes with fallback chains, BackendRouter chain-walk emitting RoutingDecision records, config validator (hard error + warn semantics), dispatch-site wiring with `HARNESS_BACKEND_OVERRIDE` env hint, RoutingDecisionBus with bounded ring buffer, 3 HTTP routes + WS topic `routing:decision`, `harness routing {config,trace,decisions}` CLI + `harness skill run --backend`, dashboard `/routing` panel (4 cards + WS + polling fallback), 5 ADRs (0029-0033). RoutingValue schema widening is additive/non-breaking (scalar form preserves byte-identical pre-Spec-B behavior).

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 4aa241f: Hermes Phase 2: Custom maintenance jobs + pre-launch OSV malware guard + disk hygiene

  Extends `MaintenanceScheduler` beyond the 21 built-in tasks with user-defined
  `customTasks` in `harness.orchestrator.md`. Adds a pre-launch OSV malware
  guard via `harness mcp-guard check`, and broadens `harness cleanup-sessions`
  into a per-target `.harness/` disk-hygiene sweep.

  **New surfaces:**
  - `CustomTaskDefinition` + `CheckScriptDefinition` + `OutputRetentionConfig` +
    `CleanupConfig` + `OsvGuardConfig` types (`@harness-engineering/types`).
  - `RunResult.origin: RunOrigin` discriminated provenance tag set by the
    scheduler / CLI / API / chain entry point.
  - `TaskOutputStore` persists per-run outputs to
    `.harness/maintenance/<task-id>/outputs/<iso>.json` with last-N + maxAgeDays
    retention. Default 50 runs / 30 days, overridable per-task.
  - `CheckScriptRunner` spawns arbitrary executables and parses a JSON status
    envelope (`{status, findings?, wakeAgent?, message?, outputs?}`) from the
    last non-empty stdout line.
  - `ContextResolver` injects `## Upstream context` (from `contextFrom`) and
    `## Reference skills` (from `inlineSkills`) into the agent prompt, with a
    warn-then-truncate token budget.
  - `validateCustomTasks` runs at orchestrator boot: cycle detection across the
    merged `contextFrom` graph, per-type required-field checks, skill / script
    existence (when injected), kebab-case task IDs, no-collision with built-ins.
  - `createOsvClient` (`@harness-engineering/core`) — OSV.dev REST client with
    24h disk cache (`.harness/cache/osv/`), fail-open default, `strict` mode.
  - `harness mcp-guard check [--strict] [--json]` CLI subcommand. Exits 2 on any
    `MAL-*` advisory match against an `.mcp.json` `mcpServers` `npx`-launched
    package. Suitable as a `pre-mcp-launch` hook from host plugin manifests.
  - `harness mcp-guard cache clear` subcommand.
  - `harness cleanup-sessions --all` / `--include` / `--exclude` extension.
    Default no-flag behavior unchanged. Registered targets: `sessions` (24h),
    `cache` (7d), `maintenance` (30d), `dashboard-state` (14d), `snapshots`
    (14d), `analyzer-output` (7d).
  - `harness maintenance list` / `harness maintenance show <task-id>` CLI
    subcommands.

  **Backwards compatibility:** All 21 built-in tasks run through the legacy
  `CheckCommandRunner` + `CommandExecutor` paths unchanged. New fields on
  `TaskDefinition` / `RunResult` / `MaintenanceConfig` are optional. The
  `harness maintenance run <task-id>` CLI subcommand and `/api/v1/jobs/maintenance/{id}/*`
  routes are deferred to a follow-up that lands alongside the Phase 0 Gateway API.

  **Knowledge artifacts:**
  - ADR 0015 — Custom maintenance task model.
  - `docs/knowledge/orchestrator/custom-maintenance-jobs.md`.
  - `docs/knowledge/cli/pre-launch-osv-guard.md`.

- c3653ff: Hermes Phase 4: Skill proposal / refinement loop with provenance + soundness gate

  Agent-emitted skill proposals routed through a review queue gated by a
  mechanical soundness check before promotion to the catalog. Closes the
  K1 killer-adoption row from the Hermes adoption meta-spec.

  **New surfaces:**
  - MCP tool `emit_skill_proposal` (tier `standard`) — writes
    `.harness/proposals/<id>.json` and emits `proposal.created`. Emit is
    non-blocking; the soundness gate fires on approve, not on emit.
  - CLI `harness proposals list|show|approve|reject` for queue management
    plus one-shot `harness backfill-skill-provenance` migration that
    stamps `provenance: user-authored` on every pre-Phase-4 catalog skill.
  - Dashboard `/s/proposals` page with inline content, gate findings,
    approve / reject / edit / run-gate actions; reviewer-UX budget < 30s
    per proposal.
  - Seven gateway routes under `/api/v1/proposals/*` (list / get /
    run-gate / approve / reject / edit) — reads use `read-status`,
    mutations require the new `manage-proposals` scope (8th entry in
    `SCOPE_VOCABULARY` and `TokenScopeSchema`).
  - Three lifecycle events (`proposal.created` / `approved` / `rejected`)
    fan out via the Phase 0 webhook bus and Phase 3 notification sinks
    with envelope derivers.
  - Maintenance task `proposal-provenance-backfill` (housekeeping #4,
    Feb 31 cron so the loop never fires automatically).

  **Strict invariants:** `kind` ↔ content shape (new-skill ⇒
  skillYaml+skillMd; refinement ⇒ targetSkill+diff); gate freshness
  < 24h before promotion; refinement edits must diverge from git HEAD
  before approval stamps provenance; provenance enum is closed
  (`community | agent-proposed | user-authored`, expansion requires ADR
  amendment).

  **Skills-mode soundness review degradation:** v1 ships mechanical
  structural checks (kebab-case name, parseable skill.yaml, SKILL.md
  bounds, unified-diff well-formedness). The full
  `harness:soundness-review --mode skill` vocabulary is a follow-up spec;
  both implementations share the same finding shape so the swap is
  purely additive.

  **Test coverage:** 75 new tests across five packages (types schema 15,
  core store + usage 9, MCP tool 8, CLI subcommand 6 + backfill 6,
  orchestrator gate 6 + promote 7 + events 4 + routes 10, envelope
  derivers 4 new rows). Existing scopes test passes with the new
  vocabulary entry.

  ADRs: 0016 (workflow), 0017 (token scope). Knowledge nodes:
  `skill-proposals.md`, `skill-provenance.md`. Spec + plan at
  `docs/changes/hermes-phase-4-skill-proposals/`.

  **Incidental fix:** Replaces a fixed 150ms wait in
  `packages/orchestrator/src/server/webhooks-integration.test.ts` with a
  poll loop. The fixed wait flaked under coverage instrumentation and
  blocked the Phase 4 pre-push hook.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d6e340: Hermes Phase 1: Session Search + Insights

  Adds a SQLite FTS5 full-text index over `.harness/sessions/` and
  `.harness/archive/sessions/`, plus an LLM-generated retrospective summary
  written to `<archive>/llm-summary.md` when a session is archived, plus a
  composite `harness insights` aggregator covering health / entropy / decay /
  attention / impact.

  **New CLI:**
  - `harness search "<query>"` — FTS5 + BM25 over indexed session memory.
  - `harness insights` — composite project report.

  **New MCP tools:**
  - `search_sessions` (tier: core)
  - `summarize_session` (tier: standard — LLM-spend implication)
  - `insights_summary` (tier: core)

  **New config (optional, all defaults are sensible):**

  ```jsonc
  {
    "sessions": {
      "search": { "indexedFileKinds": [...], "maxIndexBytesPerFile": 262144 },
      "summary": { "enabled": true, "inputBudgetTokens": 16000, "timeoutMs": 60000 }
    }
  }
  ```

  **Backwards compatible:** existing `harness.config.json` files validate
  unchanged; `archiveSession()`'s second argument is optional.

  Dashboard Search + Insights pages are deferred to follow-up roadmap item
  `hermes-phase-1.1-dashboard-ui`. See
  `docs/changes/hermes-phase-1-session-search/proposal.md` and the
  companion ADR
  `docs/knowledge/decisions/0013-hermes-phase-1-session-memory-architecture.md`.

- 2481e59: Hermes Phase 3: Multi-sink notifications + doctor hardening

  Generalizes `CINotifier` into a `NotificationSink` interface, ships Slack
  (incoming-webhook) as the first concrete in-tree adapter, adds a
  `wrap_response` envelope formatter for platform-shape delivery, and extends
  `harness doctor` with four content-aware checks (hook syntax, baseline
  freshness, session-taint corruption, live pings).

  **New surfaces:**
  - `NotificationSink` interface + `eventTypeMatches` glob matcher
    (`@harness-engineering/core`).
  - `wrapResponse(event)` envelope formatter with per-event-type handlers
    (`@harness-engineering/core`).
  - `SlackSink` and `CIGithubSink` adapters
    (`@harness-engineering/core`).
  - `SinkRegistry` + `wireNotificationSinks` orchestrator wiring
    (`@harness-engineering/orchestrator`).
  - New config block on `WorkflowConfig.notifications` with Zod schemas
    exposed from `@harness-engineering/types`.
  - `harness notifications test` CLI subcommand
    (`@harness-engineering/cli`).
  - `harness doctor` gains hook-syntax, baseline-freshness, session-taint,
    and `--live` ping checks.

  **Backwards compatible:** existing `harness.config.json` files validate
  unchanged; orchestrator boot constructs the registry only when
  `notifications.sinks` is non-empty.

  See `docs/changes/hermes-phase-3-notifications/proposal.md` for the
  full design.

- 2602530: Hermes Phase 5 — Dispatch Hardening.
  - Adds `IsolationTier` (`'none' | 'container' | 'remote-sandbox'`) as the fourth routing axis on `BackendRouter`. Configs may declare `routing.isolation.{none,container,remote-sandbox}` and tasks may issue `{ kind: 'isolation', tier }` queries.
  - Adds two new backend types: `SshBackendDef` (key-based SSH agent dispatch) and `ServerlessBackendDef` with the first `'oci'` adapter (`OciServerlessBackend` — cold-starts OCI images via `docker`/`podman`).
  - Adds per-task cost ceiling: `TaskDefinition.costCeiling = { maxUsd, warnAtPct? }` with abort-on-exceed. `RunResult.costUsd` records cumulative spend. `CostCeilingMonitor` (singleton, telemetry-driven) emits `'abort'` at the turn boundary when cumulative cost exceeds the ceiling; the dispatched task fails with `error === 'cost_ceiling_exceeded'`.
  - ADRs `0013-dispatch-isolation-tier` and `0014-cost-ceiling-policy` document the decisions.
  - Knowledge docs added under `docs/knowledge/orchestrator/` for dispatch-isolation, cost-ceiling, backends-ssh, and backends-serverless.

  No breaking changes. All existing routing use cases (`tier`, `intelligence`, `maintenance`, `chat`) resolve identically; configs without `routing.isolation` fall through to `routing.default`. Tasks without `costCeiling` execute as before.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 48e0b5b: Publish exports that landed in source without a corresponding version bump. `@harness-engineering/types@0.11.0` shipped without these symbols even though commits between 0.11.0 and now (`0db97708`, `40246b06`, `d1493fe6`, `9ba567b6`) added them to `src/index.ts`. Downstream packages (notably `@harness-engineering/orchestrator@0.4.3`) compiled their dist against the new exports and pinned `@harness-engineering/types@0.11.0`, so `npm install -g @harness-engineering/cli` resolves both at incompatible versions and the CLI fails at module load with `SyntaxError: The requested module '@harness-engineering/types' does not provide an export named 'AuthAuditEntrySchema'`.

  New exports made available in this release:
  - `AuthTokenSchema`, `AuthTokenPublicSchema`, `AuthAuditEntrySchema`, `TokenScopeSchema` and accompanying types (added in `0db97708`)
  - `WebhookSubscriptionSchema`, `WebhookSubscriptionPublicSchema`, `GatewayEventSchema` (added in `40246b06`)
  - `WebhookDeliverySchema`, `WebhookDeliveryStatusSchema` (added in `d1493fe6`)
  - `TrajectoryMetadataSchema`, `PromptCacheStatsSchema`, `OTLPSpanSchema`, `OTLPKeyValueSchema` (added in `9ba567b6`)

  Because `updateInternalDependencies` is `patch` in `.changeset/config.json`, every package that depends on `@harness-engineering/types` will receive a patch bump and a fresh dist when this release publishes, repairing the broken installs.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 8825aee: Local model fallback (Spec 1)

  `agent.localModel` may now be an array of model names; `LocalModelResolver` probes the configured local backend on a fixed interval and resolves the first available model from the list. Status is broadcast via WebSocket (`local-model:status`) and exposed at `GET /api/v1/local-model/status`. The dashboard surfaces an unhealthy-resolver banner on the Orchestrator page via the `useLocalModelStatus` hook.
  - **`@harness-engineering/types`** — `LocalModelStatus` type; `localModel` widened to `string | string[]`.
  - **`@harness-engineering/orchestrator`** — `LocalModelResolver` (probe lifecycle, idempotent loop, request timeout, overlap guard); `getModel` callback threaded through `LocalBackend` and `PiBackend` so backends read the resolved model at session/turn time instead of from raw config; `createAnalysisProvider` local branch routed through the resolver; `GET /api/v1/local-model/status` route and `local-model:status` WebSocket broadcast.
  - **`@harness-engineering/dashboard`** — `useLocalModelStatus` hook (WebSocket primary, HTTP fallback); `LocalModelBanner` rendered on the Orchestrator page when the resolver reports unhealthy.

- 8825aee: Multi-backend routing (Spec 2)

  The orchestrator now accepts a named `agent.backends` map and a per-use-case `agent.routing` map, replacing the single `agent.backend` / `agent.localBackend` pair. Routable use cases: `default`, four scope tiers (`quick-fix`, `guided-change`, `full-exploration`, `diagnostic`), and two intelligence layers (`intelligence.sel`, `intelligence.pesl`). Multi-local configurations are supported with one `LocalModelResolver` per backend. A single-runner dispatch path replaces the dual-runner split.
  - **`@harness-engineering/types`** — `BackendDef` union (`local` | `pi` | external types), `RoutingConfig`, `NamedLocalModelStatus`.
  - **`@harness-engineering/orchestrator`** — `BackendDefSchema` and `RoutingConfigSchema` (Zod); `migrateAgentConfig` shim for legacy `agent.backend` / `agent.localBackend` (warn-once at startup); `createBackend` factory; `BackendRouter` (use-case → backend resolution with intelligence-layer fallback); `AnalysisProviderFactory` (routed `BackendDef` → `AnalysisProvider`, distinct PESL provider); `OrchestratorBackendFactory` wrapping router + factory + container; `validateWorkflowConfig` SC15 enforcement; `Map<name, LocalModelResolver>` with per-resolver `NamedLocalModelStatus` broadcast; `GET /api/v1/local-models/status` array endpoint (singular `/local-model/status` retained as deprecated alias); `PiBackend` `timeoutMs` plumbed via `AbortController`.
  - **`@harness-engineering/intelligence`** — `IntelligencePipeline` accepts a distinct `peslProvider` so the SEL and PESL layers can resolve to different backends.
  - **`@harness-engineering/dashboard`** — `useLocalModelStatuses` (renamed from singular) consumes `/api/v1/local-models/status` and merges `NamedLocalModelStatus[]` by `backendName`; the Orchestrator page renders one `LocalModelBanner` per unhealthy backend.

  **Deprecation:** `agent.backend` and `agent.localBackend` continue to work via the migration shim, which synthesizes `agent.backends.primary` / `agent.backends.local` plus a `routing` map mirroring `escalation.autoExecute`. Hard removal lands in a follow-up release per ADR 0005.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- f62d6ab: Supply chain audit — fix HIGH vulnerability, bump dependencies, migrate openai to v6
- f62d6ab: Resolve V8 coverage race and Windows perf timeout in CI

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- fix(telemetry): use `distinct_id` (snake_case) for PostHog batch API

  PostHog requires `distinct_id` but the code sent `distinctId` (camelCase), causing all telemetry events to be silently rejected with HTTP 400. Added identity fallbacks from `harness.config.json` name and `git config user.name`. Added `harness telemetry test` command for verifying PostHog connectivity.

### Patch Changes

- fix(ci): cross-platform CI fixes for Windows test timeouts and coverage scripts

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- Document usage types (UsageRecord, ModelPricing, DailyUsage, SessionUsage) and external tracker types (ExternalTicket, ExternalTicketState, SyncResult, TrackerSyncConfig) in API reference

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Reduce Tier 2 structural violations and fix exactOptionalPropertyTypes errors

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `title` field to `ExternalTicketState` interface for title-based dedup during push sync. Prevents duplicate GitHub issues when externalIds are missing from the roadmap.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- `TrackerSyncAdapter` interface extended with `getAuthenticatedUser()` method for retrieving the token owner's GitHub username. Enables auto-population of assignee fields during sync.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Roadmap sync, auto-pick, and assignment
  - **External tracker sync** — Bidirectional sync between roadmap.md and GitHub Issues via `TrackerSyncAdapter` interface. Split authority: roadmap owns planning fields, GitHub owns execution/assignment. Sync fires on every state transition (task-start, task-complete, phase-start, phase-complete, save-handoff, archive_session).
  - **Auto-pick pilot** — New `harness-roadmap-pilot` skill with AI-assisted next-item selection. Two-tier scoring: explicit priority first (P0-P3), then weighted position/dependents/affinity score. Routes to brainstorming (no spec) or autopilot (spec exists).
  - **Assignment with affinity** — Assignee, Priority, and External-ID fields on roadmap features. Assignment history section in roadmap.md enables affinity-based routing. Reassignment produces audit trail (unassigned + assigned records).
  - **New types** — `Priority`, `AssignmentRecord`, `ExternalTicket`, `ExternalTicketState`, `SyncResult`, `TrackerSyncConfig` in @harness-engineering/types.
  - **Config schema** — `TrackerConfigSchema` and `RoadmapConfigSchema` added to `HarnessConfigSchema` for validated tracker configuration.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- dc88a2e: Codebase hardening: normalize package scripts, deduplicate Result type, tighten API surface, expand test coverage, and fix documentation drift.

  **Breaking (core):** Removed 6 internal helpers from the entropy barrel export: `resolveEntryPoints`, `parseDocumentationFile`, `findPossibleMatches`, `levenshteinDistance`, `buildReachabilityMap`, `checkConfigPattern`. These were implementation details not used by any downstream package. If you imported them directly from `@harness-engineering/core`, import from the specific detector file instead (e.g., `@harness-engineering/core/src/entropy/detectors/drift`).

  **core:** `Result<T,E>` is now re-exported from `@harness-engineering/types` instead of being defined separately. No consumer-facing change.

  **All packages:** Normalized scripts (consistent `test`, `test:watch`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `clean`). Added mcp-server to root tsconfig references.

  **mcp-server:** Fixed 5 `no-explicit-any` lint errors in architecture, feedback, and validate tools.

  **Test coverage:** Added 96 new tests across 13 new test files (types, cli subcommands, mcp-server tools).

  **Documentation:** Rewrote cli.md and configuration.md to match actual implementation. Fixed 10 inaccuracies in AGENTS.md.
