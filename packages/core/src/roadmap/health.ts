/**
 * Roadmap maintenance: health checks (read-only diagnostics) and grooming
 * (pure state transitions) that keep `docs/roadmap.md` tidy over time.
 *
 * The same predicates power two consumers:
 *  - `checkRoadmapHealth` — surfaced by `harness validate` as a regression guard.
 *  - `groomRoadmap` — applied by the roadmap skill's `--groom` mode to remediate.
 *
 * Design principle these encode: **a milestone is a theme, a status is a
 * lifecycle stage.** Lifecycle catch-all milestones ("Backlog", "Current Work")
 * are an anti-pattern; done work belongs in an archive; and a `planned` row with
 * neither a spec nor a plan is invisible-but-noisy to the orchestrator (it infers
 * `full-exploration` scope and always escalates to a human).
