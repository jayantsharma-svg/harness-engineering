# @harness-engineering/dashboard

Local web dashboard for harness project health, roadmap visualization, orchestrator monitoring, and knowledge graph exploration. Built with React + Hono, with Server-Sent Events for live updates.

## Quick Start

```bash
# From any harness-enabled project:
harness dashboard

# Or during development (from packages/dashboard):
pnpm dev
```

The dashboard opens at `http://localhost:3701` by default. The `harness dashboard` command auto-opens the browser (pass `--no-open` to suppress).

## CLI Options

```bash
harness dashboard [options]

  --port <port>      Client dev server port (default: 3700)
  --api-port <port>  API server port (default: 3701)
  --no-open          Do not automatically open browser
  --cwd <path>       Project directory (defaults to cwd)
```

## Pages

The dashboard has 11 pages:

| Page               | Route           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

    shared/              Types, constants, and type guards shared between client and server
```

### Client-Server Communication

The dashboard uses two communication patterns:

**SSE (Server-Sent Events)** -- The Overview, Health, Roadmap, and Graph pages subscribe to `/api/sse`. The server runs a shared polling loop (default 30s interval) that gathers roadmap, health, and graph data and broadcasts to all connected clients. Expensive checks (security, perf, arch, anomalies) run once on first connection and are cached for subsequent clients.

**WebSocket** -- The Orchestrator and Attention pages connect to the orchestrator's WebSocket at `/ws` for real-time snapshots of running agents, pending interactions, rate limits, and agent streaming events.

**REST** -- All pages can also fetch data via REST endpoints. The Adoption, Impact, and Chat pages use direct API calls.

| `DASHBOARD_CLIENT_PORT` | `3700`  | Vite dev server port            |
| `HARNESS_PROJECT_PATH`  | `cwd()` | Project root for data gathering |

### Constants

| Constant                   | Value            | Description                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `API_PORT`                 | `3701`           | Default API server port           |

| `GRAPH_DIR`                | `.harness/graph` | Knowledge graph directory path    |

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev mode (Vite client + tsx server, hot reload)
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Type check
pnpm typecheck

# Lint
pnpm lint
```

In dev mode, `pnpm dev` runs the Vite client dev server (port 3700) and the Hono API server (port 3701) concurrently. In production, the Hono server serves both the API and the built client assets from a single port (3701).
