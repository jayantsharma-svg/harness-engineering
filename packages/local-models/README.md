# @harness-engineering/local-models

Hardware-aware local-model recommender, pool manager, and proposal engine for Harness Engineering's **Local Model Lifecycle Manager (LMLM)**.

See [`docs/changes/local-model-lifecycle-manager/proposal.md`](../../docs/changes/local-model-lifecycle-manager/proposal.md) for the full spec.

## Status

**Phase 0 — scaffolding only.** No business logic yet. Hardware detection, ranking, pool management, Ollama installer, proposal engine, and scheduler ship in subsequent phases.

## Goals (recap)

- Detect the operator's hardware (Apple Silicon / NVIDIA / CPU) and rank Hugging Face models for that hardware.
- Manage a disk-budget-bounded pool of installed Ollama models within an operator-approved org/family allowlist.
- Propose pool changes through the existing hermes-phase-4 review queue with single approve/reject UX.
- Drive recommendations via the live HuggingFace API with a frozen-snapshot fallback for offline environments.
