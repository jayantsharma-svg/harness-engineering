/**
 * Lineage-aware recency demotion.
 *
 * Benchmarks rot. A leaderboard score posted twelve months ago against an
 * older inference runtime — or worse, an older generation of the same model
 * family — tells the ranker less about today's `(model, quant)` than a fresh
 * score against the exact target. The merge in `./benchmarks/merge.ts` folds
 * every observation through this module to derive a recency *weight* on
 * `[0, 1]` that the cross-source merge multiplies into the contribution.
 *
 * The decay is intentionally simple: one exponential with a single halflife
 * constant. Phase 2d's parity fixtures pin the halflife against the whichllm
 * reference outputs; a future Phase can swap in per-family curves if any
 * lineage exhibits faster or slower decay than the calibration set.
 *
 * Lineage demotion is independent of the age curve. An observation against
 * `Qwen2.5` when the ranker is scoring `Qwen3` gets an additional
 * per-generation penalty (`× LINEAGE_STEP_PENALTY` per step behind the
 * target) on top of the age-based decay, because architectural changes
 * between generations matter even when the leaderboard score is fresh.
 *
 * Floor: every weight is clamped to `MIN_RECENCY_WEIGHT` (`0.05`). Zeroing
 * observations entirely would let a single fresh contribution dominate the
 * merge; the floor keeps the long tail in the weighted mean.
 *
 * @see docs/changes/local-model-lifecycle-manager/proposal.md (lines 80–87, Q5 success criterion)
