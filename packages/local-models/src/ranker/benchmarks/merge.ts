/**
 * Cross-source benchmark merge.
 *
 * The ranker (Phase 2d) calls `mergeBenchmarks` once per candidate model to
 * fold every `BenchmarkObservation` the source adapters surfaced — plus
 * whatever the frozen snapshot contributes — into a single
 * `{ score, confidence, contributions }` triple. The merge is intentionally
 * a *weighted mean*, not a winner-takes-all selection: stacked evidence
 * across sources should reinforce a strong model and stacked weak evidence
 * should pull a self-reported claim down.
 *
 * Each contribution's weight composes three independent multipliers:
 *
 *   weight = evidenceConfidence × recencyWeight × sourceWeight
 *
 * `evidenceConfidence` comes from `../evidence.ts` (`direct = 1.0`, …,
 * `self-reported = 0.35`). `recencyWeight` comes from `../recency.ts`
 * (exponential decay with a lineage penalty). `sourceWeight` defaults to
 * `DEFAULT_SOURCE_WEIGHTS` and can be overridden per call — the proposal
 * scheduler in Phase 6 will surface this through `harness.config.json`.
 *
 * The merge also normalises source-native value scales (`open-llm-leaderboard`
 * is already on `0..100`; `hf-popularity` is too, after the adapter's per-
 * fetch normalisation). Unknown sources default to a `clamp(value, 0, 100)`
 * pass-through so any future adapter that emits on the same scale plugs in
 * without a code change.
 *
 * Confidence labels are derived deterministically from the contribution mix:
 *
 *   - `'high'`   — at least one `direct` observation with `recencyWeight ≥ 0.8`.
 *   - `'low'`    — no observation graded above `interpolated`, *or* every
 *                  combined weight `< 0.3`.
 *   - `'medium'` — otherwise.
 *
 * Empty input short-circuits to `{ score: 0, confidence: 'low', contributions: [] }`
 * — never throws (S4 from the spec).
 *
 * @see docs/changes/local-model-lifecycle-manager/proposal.md (Q4, Q5, S4)
