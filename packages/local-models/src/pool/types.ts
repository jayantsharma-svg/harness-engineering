/**
 * Pool — runtime types.
 *
 * Phase 3a stub. Mirrors the runtime shapes defined in
 * `docs/changes/local-model-lifecycle-manager/proposal.md` (lines 140–157)
 * verbatim so later phases (3b installer + manager, 4 resolver, 5b proposals,
 * 6 scheduler) consume them through the package barrel without re-modeling.
 *
 * The persisted shape is intentionally minimal: only the fields the proposal
 * defines on `PoolEntry` / `PoolState` survive a crash + reload cycle.
 * Transient status (e.g. `pendingEviction`, `pendingInstall`) lives on a
 * separate runtime record introduced in Phase 3b alongside the install state
 * machine, so a crash mid-pull cannot leave a stale flag pinned on disk.
 *
 * @see docs/changes/local-model-lifecycle-manager/proposal.md (Phase 3, lines 431–443)
