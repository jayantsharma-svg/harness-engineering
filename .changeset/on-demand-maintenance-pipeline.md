Add an on-demand maintenance pipeline: `harness maintenance run [taskId...]` and the `/harness:maintenance-pipeline` skill.

The command runs the maintenance that is actually **overdue** (computed from each task's cron schedule + `history.json`) in a **report-first**, infra-free sweep — no orchestrator, gateway, or `ClaimManager` required. `--all`/`--only`/`--skip` scope selection, `--json` emits a consolidated `ConsolidatedReport` (also written to `.harness/maintenance/last-run-summary.json`), and exit codes are CI-friendly (`0` completed, `1` a task failed to execute, `2` invalid invocation).

Built on a single shared executor: a `mode: 'report' | 'fix'` parameter on `TaskRunner` (default `fix` leaves cron unchanged), a `selectTasks` overdue/eligibility selector with an `excludeFromHumanSweep` flag on task definitions, and a shared `runHarnessCheck` core used by both the CLI and the cron scheduler. `--fix` dispatches the real maintenance agent dispatcher when an `agent.backends` backend is configured, and skips honestly otherwise.

This work also corrected pre-existing bugs that affected the cron scheduler too: maintenance check commands now resolve through the harness binary (previously ENOENT), check-execution failures are reported as `failure` instead of being masked as `success`, and two misconfigured built-in checks (`cross-check`, `stale-constraints`) gained real read-only CLI subcommands. ADRs 0049 (one executor, two callers) and 0050 (report-first on-demand) document the design.
