Spec B (Granular Task→Backend Routing): per-skill + per-cognitive-mode routing axes with fallback chains, BackendRouter chain-walk emitting RoutingDecision records, config validator (hard error + warn semantics), dispatch-site wiring with `HARNESS_BACKEND_OVERRIDE` env hint, RoutingDecisionBus with bounded ring buffer, 3 HTTP routes + WS topic `routing:decision`, `harness routing {config,trace,decisions}` CLI + `harness skill run --backend`, dashboard `/routing` panel (4 cards + WS + polling fallback), 5 ADRs (0029-0033). RoutingValue schema widening is additive/non-breaking (scalar form preserves byte-identical pre-Spec-B behavior).
