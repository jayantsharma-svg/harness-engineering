# Harness Engineering: AI Agent Knowledge Map

This is the single source of truth for AI agents working on the Harness Engineering project. It provides essential context about our repository structure, architecture, conventions, and where to find information.

## Project Overview

**Harness Engineering** is a comprehensive toolkit for transitioning from manual coding to **agent-first development**. We help teams architect software in ways that enable AI agents to execute, maintain, and improve code reliably and autonomously.

### Purpose and Goals

- Create a reusable library and toolkit for agent-first development
- Establish patterns that make AI-driven development predictable and scalable
- Document architectural decisions as the single source of truth
- Enforce constraints mechanically rather than through code review
- Measure and improve agent autonomy over time

### Current Phase

**Complete** — All core packages (types, core, cli, eslint-plugin, linter-gen, graph, intelligence, dashboard, orchestrator), 741 skills (claude-code, gemini-cli, codex, and cursor), 12 personas, 19 templates, and 3 progressive examples are implemented. The project is in adoption and refinement mode. See `examples/` for progressive tutorials.

## Strategic Anchor

This repository ships a **Strategic Anchor system** for projects that adopt
harness. The anchor lives at `STRATEGY.md` in the repo root (peer of
`README.md`) and grounds downstream agent skills with product-level context
that the codebase alone cannot supply.

### What STRATEGY.md is

A short, durable file with five required sections (`Target problem`,
`Our approach`, `Who it's for`, `Key metrics`, `Tracks`) plus three optional
sections (`Milestones`, `Not working on`, `Marketing`). Frontmatter carries
`name`, `last_updated` (ISO date), and `version`. Schema authority lives in
`packages/types/src/strategy.ts` (cross-layer contract) and
`packages/core/src/strategy/schema.ts` (Zod runtime validator). `harness validate`
checks shape when the file exists.

### How agents should read it

1. **Before brainstorming a new feature** — `harness-brainstorming` Phase 1
   EXPLORE reads `STRATEGY.md` if present and cites it as grounding in the
   spec's `evidence` section. If a feature contradicts the strategy, surface
   the contradiction explicitly during EVALUATE rather than auto-resolving.

2. **Before picking the next roadmap item** — `harness-roadmap-pilot` Phase 2
   RECOMMEND reads `STRATEGY.md` and applies strategy-alignment as a
   tiebreaker bonus on top of impact × confidence ÷ effort.

3. **Before generating candidate ideas** — `harness-ideate` reads
   `STRATEGY.md` as grounding before producing ranked ideation under
   `docs/ideation/<slug>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

4. **As graph-queryable facts** — `BusinessKnowledgeIngestor.ingestStrategy`
   (in `packages/graph/src/ingest/`) emits one `business_fact` node per
   non-empty section. Nodes are tagged with `metadata.domain === 'strategy'`
   and `metadata.source === 'STRATEGY.md'`. Query examples:
   - `findNodes({ type: 'business_fact' })` filtered by `metadata.domain === 'strategy'`
     returns all strategy sections.
   - `getNode('bk:strategy:target-problem')` returns the target-problem fact.

### What agents must not do

- **Do not auto-generate `STRATEGY.md` from code, commits, ADRs, or roadmap state.**
  Strategy is interview-driven only ([ADR-0036](docs/knowledge/decisions/0036-strategy-is-interview-driven.md)).
  The interview lives in the `harness-strategy` skill and enforces pushback
  rules (fluff detection, goal-as-strategy rejection,
  feature-list-as-strategy rejection) capped at 2 rounds per section.
- **Do not write `STRATEGY.md` section bodies** from any skill other than
  `harness-strategy`. (Tooling may bump `version` / `last_updated`
  frontmatter; section bodies are off-limits.)
- **Do not conflate `STRATEGY.md` with `harness-roadmap.md`.** Strategy is
  durable product-level anchor; roadmap is tactical phase tracker. See
  [ADR-0035](docs/knowledge/decisions/0035-strategy-anchor-vs-roadmap-md.md)
  and [`docs/conventions/strategy-vs-roadmap.md`](docs/conventions/strategy-vs-roadmap.md).
- **Do not block on absence.** STRATEGY.md is opt-in. Every consumer
  soft-fails when the file is missing — agents must do the same.

### Adoption surface

- `/harness:strategy` — run interview / update STRATEGY.md.
- `/harness:ideate` — generate ranked candidate ideas grounded in strategy.
- `initialize-harness-project` Phase 3 — 3-way yes/no/later question on
  capturing strategy at project init. Decline persists in
  `.harness/state.json` as `init.strategy.declined: true` so re-runs
  respect prior decision.

## Repository Structure

This is a **monorepo** using pnpm workspaces and Turborepo for orchestration.

### Package Relationships

- **types** → Shared type definitions (no dependencies)
- **core** → Runtime library (depends on types)
- **graph** → Knowledge graph for codebase relationships and entropy detection (depends on types)
- **orchestrator** → Agent orchestration and multi-agent coordination (depends on core)
- All packages follow strict dependency rules: no circular dependencies, no upward dependencies

## Architecture

### Layered Architecture

We follow a strict, one-way dependency model:

```
Types (bottom layer - no dependencies)
  ↓
Configuration & Constants
  ↓
Repository & Data Access
  ↓
Services & Business Logic
  ↓
Agents & External Interfaces (top layer)
```

**Key Rule**: Layers can only depend on lower layers, never upward.

### Design Decisions

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode** - All code runs with strict type checking enabled
2. **Project References** - We use tsconfig project references for proper compilation order and dependency validation
3. **Monorepo Structure** - Enables shared code and consistent tooling across packages
4. **Documentation-First** - All architectural decisions live in git as version-controlled markdown
5. **Result<T, E> Pattern** - Explicit error handling using Result types (similar to Rust's Result)

### Module Boundaries

Each package has a clear responsibility:

- **types**: Type definitions, interfaces, and constants used across packages
- **graph**: Knowledge graph store, ContextQL queries, code/git/knowledge ingestion, FusionLayer search
- **core**: Runtime library with validation, constraints, entropy detection, architecture checks, and pricing/cost calculation (depends on types, graph)
- **eslint-plugin**: ESLint rules for architectural constraint enforcement (depends on types, core)
- **linter-gen**: YAML-to-ESLint rule generator (depends on types, core)
- **intelligence**: Intelligence pipeline for spec enrichment, complexity modeling, and pre-execution simulation (depends on types, graph)
- **orchestrator**: Agent orchestration daemon for dispatching coding agents to issues. Modern config surface is `agent.backends` (named-map) + `agent.routing` (per-use-case). Routing supports per-skill + per-cognitive-mode axes with fallback chains; dashboard `/routing` panel and `harness routing {config,trace,decisions}` CLI surface decision telemetry. Legacy `agent.backend` / `agent.localBackend` accepted via in-memory migration shim with deprecation warning. (depends on types, core, intelligence)
- **dashboard**: Web dashboard — React + Hono full-stack app with 12 pages (Adoption, Analyze, Attention, DecayTrends, Graph, Health, Impact, Maintenance, Orchestrator, Roadmap, Streams, Traceability), SSE-based live updates, and server-side data gathering (depends on types, core, graph)
- **cli**: CLI tool and MCP server — top-level integration layer (depends on all packages)

### Git Workflow and Commit Conventions

We use **Conventional Commits** for clear, machine-readable commit messages:

```
type(scope): brief description

Optional longer explanation of the change and why it was made.
```

**Commit Types:**

- `feat:` - New feature or functionality
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes (no code changes)
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code changes without new features or fixes
- `test:` - Test additions or modifications
- `chore:` - Dependency updates, tooling, etc.

**Example Commits:**

```
feat(core): add Result type for error handling
fix(types): correct generic constraints on Handler interface
docs: update AGENTS.md with architecture overview
refactor(core): simplify validation logic
test(core): add tests for Result type
```

## Key Concepts

### Result<T, E> Pattern

We use a Result type (similar to Rust) for explicit error handling:

```typescript
type Result<T, E> = { ok: true; value: T } | { ok: false; error: E };
```

This provides:

- **Explicit error handling** - No surprise errors
- **Type-safe operations** - Compiler enforces error handling
- **Clear intent** - Functions signal they may fail
- **Composability** - Easy to chain operations

### TypeScript Project References

We use `tsconfig.json` project references for:

- **Proper compilation order** - Dependencies compile first
- **Incremental builds** - Only rebuild what changed
- **Dependency validation** - Prevent circular dependencies
- **Clear boundaries** - Explicit package dependencies

Configuration example:

```json
{
  "references": [{ "path": "./packages/types" }, { "path": "./packages/core" }]
}
```

_Skill Proposals (Hermes Phase 4):_ `emit_skill_proposal` (tier `standard`) — agents emit candidate skills or refinements; proposals land at `.harness/proposals/<id>.json` with `status: open`. Reviewers triage via the dashboard `/s/proposals` page or the `harness proposals list|show|approve|reject` CLI. The soundness-review gate runs at approve time, not at emit time; promotion writes skill files into `agents/skills/claude-code/<name>/` with `provenance: agent-proposed` + `originatingProposalId`. Pre-Phase-4 skills are backfilled with `provenance: user-authored` via `harness backfill-skill-provenance`. New token scope: `manage-proposals` (ADR 0017).

### Telemetry Subsystem

Anonymous product analytics collection implemented across `packages/types`, `packages/core`, and `packages/cli`. Zero vendor SDK dependencies -- uses Node's built-in `fetch()` to POST events to PostHog's HTTP batch API.

**Architecture:**

- **Types** (`packages/types/src/telemetry.ts`): `TelemetryConfig`, `TelemetryIdentity`, `ConsentState`, `TelemetryEvent`
- **Core** (`packages/core/src/telemetry/`):
  - `consent.ts` -- Merges env vars (`DO_NOT_TRACK`, `HARNESS_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`), config (`telemetry.enabled`), and `.harness/telemetry.json` identity into a `ConsentState`
  - `install-id.ts` -- Creates/reads a persistent anonymous UUIDv4 at `.harness/.install-id`
  - `collector.ts` -- Reads `adoption.jsonl` and formats `TelemetryEvent` payloads
  - `transport.ts` -- HTTP POST to PostHog `/batch` with 3 retries, 5s timeout, silent failure
- **CLI** (`packages/cli/src/commands/telemetry/`): `identify` (set/clear `.harness/telemetry.json`), `status` (display consent state, install ID, identity, env overrides)
- **Hook** (`packages/cli/src/hooks/telemetry-reporter.js`): Stop hook that runs the full pipeline (consent check, collect, send, first-run notice)

**Consent priority:** `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` > `HARNESS_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1` > `harness.config.json telemetry.enabled` > default (enabled)

**Data sent (when enabled):** install ID, OS, Node version, harness version, skill name, duration, outcome. Identity fields (project, team, alias) only when explicitly set in `.harness/telemetry.json`.

**Data NOT sent:** file paths, file contents, code, prompts, or any PII unless user opts in via identity fields.

### Orchestrator Gateway API (Hermes Phase 0)

`packages/orchestrator/src/server/http.ts` exposes a token-scoped, versioned HTTP API. Phases 1, 2, and 3 of the Hermes proposal have landed the auth substrate, audit log, OpenAPI artifact, `/api/v1/*` route doubling with `Deprecation` headers, three bridge-primitive endpoints, an SSE event-bus stream, and HMAC-signed webhook subscriptions with in-memory fan-out. Phase 4 will add durable webhook delivery (SQLite queue, exponential-backoff retry ladder, DLQ, drain-on-shutdown); Phase 5 will add OTLP telemetry export.

**Authentication model.** Every `/api/*` request flows through `dispatchAuthedRequest`. Tokens are bearer-format: `Authorization: Bearer tok_<16-hex-id>.<base64url-secret>`. Records persist in `.harness/tokens.json` as bcryptjs-hashed secrets (cost 12) with `id`, `name`, `scopes`, `createdAt`, optional `expiresAt`, optional `tenantId`, optional `bridgeKind`. The plaintext secret is returned exactly once at creation.

**Scope vocabulary** (pinned in `packages/orchestrator/src/auth/scopes.ts`): `admin`, `trigger-job`, `read-status`, `resolve-interaction`, `subscribe-webhook`, `modify-roadmap`, `read-telemetry`. `admin` is a superset. Changes to this set require an ADR. `requiredScopeForRoute(method, path)` maps every routed path to its required scope; unmapped routes default-deny (403 after audit).

**Audit log.** `.harness/audit.log` is append-only JSONL written best-effort by `AuditLogger`. Every request produces exactly one line: `{timestamp, tokenId, tenantId?, route, method, status}`. Status is captured at `res.on('finish')` — the wire-final status, not whatever was set before an async handler resolved. Request payloads and response bodies are never recorded. Write failures degrade silently (the request handler must keep serving).

**Versioned `/api/v1/*` surface (Phase 2).** Every legacy `/api/<name>(/...)` route is reachable at `/api/v1/<name>(/...)` via a URL rewrite inside `dispatchAuthedRequest`. A twelve-slug `V1_WRAPPABLE` set in `http.ts:413-426` (interactions, plans, analyze, analyses, roadmap-actions, dispatch-actions, local-model, local-models, maintenance, streams, sessions, chat-proxy) gates the rewrite; `/api/v1/state` is handled by an inlined shortcut. Legacy `/api/*` responses carry `Deprecation: 2027-05-14` (override via `HARNESS_DEPRECATION_DATE` env-var); `/api/v1/*` responses do not. The Deprecation gating keys off the **pre-rewrite** URL — the load-bearing invariant verified in `http-v1-aliases.test.ts`.

**Bridge primitives (Phase 2).** Three operational endpoints land natively under `/api/v1/`, handlers in `packages/orchestrator/src/server/routes/v1/`:

- `POST /api/v1/jobs/maintenance` (scope `trigger-job`, body `{taskId}`) — dispatches via `Orchestrator.dispatchAdHoc`; 200/404/409.
- `POST /api/v1/interactions/{id}/resolve` (scope `resolve-interaction`) — `InteractionQueue.updateStatus(id, 'resolved')` + emits `interaction.resolved` on the event bus; 200/404/409.
- `GET /api/v1/events` (scope `read-telemetry`) — Server-Sent Events stream of the orchestrator event bus.

**SSE event bus (Phase 2, extended in Phase 3).** `GET /api/v1/events` fans **eleven** event topics out as SSE frames after Phase 3: the nine Phase 2 topics (`state_change`, `agent_event`, `interaction.created`, `interaction.resolved`, `maintenance:started`, `maintenance:completed`, `maintenance:error`, `maintenance:baseref_fallback`, `local-model:status`) plus the two webhook lifecycle topics (`webhook.subscription.created`, `webhook.subscription.deleted`). Frame format: `event: <topic>\ndata: <json>\nid: evt_<8-byte-hex>\n\n`. 15-second heartbeat comment frames; `X-Accel-Buffering: no` defeats proxy buffering; cleanup on `close`/`finish` removes every subscribed listener. `Orchestrator extends EventEmitter` and calls `this.setMaxListeners(50)` in the constructor to absorb the multi-topic subscribe-on-connect pattern (Node default is 10). `InteractionQueue.constructor(dir, emitter?)` accepts the orchestrator as the optional bus; `push()` emits `interaction.created`, `updateStatus(id, 'resolved')` emits `interaction.resolved`. WebSocket fan-out via `server.broadcastInteraction` continues to run alongside event-bus emission for legacy dashboard consumers.

**Webhook subscriptions (Phase 3).** Three new routes under `/api/v1/webhooks` (`packages/orchestrator/src/server/routes/v1/webhooks.ts`): `POST /api/v1/webhooks` creates a subscription and returns the HMAC secret **exactly once**; `DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/{id}` revokes (stops fan-out within ~200ms — synchronous filter on every emit); `GET /api/v1/webhooks` lists secret-redacted subscriptions for the bearer's tokenId. All three require the `subscribe-webhook` scope. URL validation rejects `http://` URLs with 422. The three webhook path-method pairs (plus the Phase 2 bridge primitives) live in `V1_BRIDGE_ROUTES` (`packages/orchestrator/src/server/v1-bridge-routes.ts`) — single source of truth that both `buildApiRoutes()` and `scopes.ts` consume (closes Phase 2 cycle-2 DELTA-SUG-1).

**HMAC signing (Phase 3).** `packages/orchestrator/src/gateway/webhooks/signer.ts` signs the verbatim request body with the subscription's secret. Header format: `X-Harness-Signature: sha256=<lowercase-hex>`. Every delivery carries four canonical headers: `X-Harness-Signature`, `X-Harness-Delivery-Id` (`dlv_<8-byte-hex>`), `X-Harness-Event-Type` (normalized dotted form), `X-Harness-Timestamp` (Unix millis). Bridges verify with a ~5-line stdlib snippet: `'sha256=' + createHmac('sha256', secret).update(rawBody).digest('hex')` plus `timingSafeEqual`. The body-verbatim contract means bridges MUST verify against raw bytes BEFORE parsing JSON — see the integration test at `packages/orchestrator/src/server/webhooks-integration.test.ts:40-51` which is the spec exit-gate proof.

**Webhook secret storage (Phase 3).** `WebhookStore` (`packages/orchestrator/src/gateway/webhooks/store.ts`) persists subscriptions to `.harness/webhooks.json` with `fs.chmod(path, 0o600)` after every write — secrets stored **plaintext at rest** per ADR 0011 § "Webhook secret storage model (Phase 3)" (industry pattern at single-tenant scope: infrastructure-layer encryption via FDE, not application-layer; alternatives rejected with rationale). `.gitignore` excludes `**/.harness/webhooks.json` (added alongside `tokens.json` and `audit.log` so all three runtime secret artifacts share one block). Rotation is delete-and-recreate.

**Event-bus fan-out with segment-glob filter (Phase 3).** `wireWebhookFanout` (`packages/orchestrator/src/gateway/webhooks/events.ts`) subscribes to 9 orchestrator topics and normalizes colon-separated legacy topics to dotted form (`maintenance:started` → `maintenance.started`) before running the segment-glob filter (`eventMatches` in `signer.ts:43-51`). A subscription with `events: ['maintenance.*']` therefore matches all four `maintenance:*` emits. Match semantics: split on `.`, segment count must match (no `**`), each segment is literal or `*`. **Phase 3 delivery is in-memory, best-effort, 3-second timeout, no retry, no DLQ** — Phase 4 lands the durable counterpart with the same `WebhookDelivery.deliver(sub, event)` API shape (additive swap).

**Dashboard `/s/webhooks` page (Phase 3).** `packages/dashboard/src/client/pages/Webhooks.tsx` provides list / create / revoke UI. Registered as the 12th entry in `SYSTEM_PAGES` (`packages/dashboard/src/client/types/thread.ts:67`) and bound in `ThreadView.tsx:40`. Create flow renders the one-shot secret reveal panel. The page inherits the `dashboard-browser-auth-context` carry-forward from Phase 2 — Phase 4 should address or escalate.

**CLI.** `harness gateway token create --name <label> --scopes <csv>` mints a new token (one-time secret reveal in stdout). `harness gateway token list` lists records with secrets redacted. `harness gateway token revoke <id>` deletes a record.

**MCP tools (Phase 2 + Phase 3).** `trigger_maintenance_job` (tier-1, standard+) calls `POST /api/v1/jobs/maintenance`; `list_gateway_tokens` (tier-0, core+) calls `GET /api/v1/auth/tokens`. Phase 3 added `subscribe_webhook` at tier-1 (`packages/cli/src/mcp/tools/webhook-tools.ts`); tier assignments in `packages/cli/src/mcp/tool-tiers.ts` (`CORE_TOOL_NAMES` line 26 holds `list_gateway_tokens`; `STANDARD_EXTRA` holds `trigger_maintenance_job` and `subscribe_webhook` lines 57-58). Three separate test assertions across `server.test.ts`, `server-integration.test.ts`, and `setup-mcp.test.ts` pin the tool-count total so drift on additions or removals fails the test suite.

**Dashboard.** `/s/tokens` (registered via `SYSTEM_PAGES` in `packages/dashboard/src/client/types/thread.ts`) provides a list/create/revoke UI. The dashboard does NOT mount a parallel `TokenStore`; the page calls `/api/v1/auth/*` on the dashboard server, and `packages/dashboard/src/server/orchestrator-proxy.ts` proxies the `/api/v1` prefix (in `ORCHESTRATOR_PREFIXES`) through to the orchestrator, preserving `Authorization`. Single-writer invariant on `.harness/tokens.json`: only the orchestrator writes it. See "Route Ownership" in [`docs/knowledge/orchestrator/gateway-api.md`](docs/knowledge/orchestrator/gateway-api.md).

**Compatibility signals.**

- `HARNESS_API_TOKEN` env-var: still authenticates, as a synthetic admin token (backward-compat invariant).
- `X-Harness-Auth-Mode: unauth-dev` response header: present on every reply when the orchestrator is in localhost-dev fallback (tokens.json empty AND `HARNESS_API_TOKEN` unset). A one-time `console.warn` fires on the first request in this mode per process.
- `Deprecation: <ISO-date>` response header: present on every response from a legacy `/api/<name>` route (not on `/api/v1/<name>`). Default `2027-05-14`; override via `HARNESS_DEPRECATION_DATE`.

**OpenAPI artifact.** `docs/api/openapi.yaml` is generated from Zod schemas via `@asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi` (orchestrator npm script `openapi:generate`). Phase 3 extended coverage to **18 paths** (3 auth + 3 bridge + 10 documented legacy aliases + 2 webhook routes; `/api/v1/webhooks` is POST+GET on one path, `/api/v1/webhooks/{id}` is DELETE on another). Version bumped to v0.3.0. CI workflow `.github/workflows/openapi-drift-check.yml` regenerates the artifact on every PR and fails on drift; the emitter is byte-identical across re-runs.

See [`docs/knowledge/orchestrator/gateway-api.md`](docs/knowledge/orchestrator/gateway-api.md) for the gateway API contract business-process node, [`docs/knowledge/orchestrator/webhook-fanout.md`](docs/knowledge/orchestrator/webhook-fanout.md) for the Phase 3 webhook fan-out pipeline (subscription lifecycle, segment-glob filter, delivery worker, Phase 4 extension points), and [ADR 0011](docs/knowledge/decisions/0011-orchestrator-gateway-api-contract.md) (status: in-progress, promotion to `accepted` deferred to Phase 4 + Phase 5) for the contract decisions including the "Webhook secret storage model (Phase 3)" addendum.

### Notifications (Hermes Phase 3)

`packages/orchestrator/src/notifications/` ships an in-process `NotificationSink` abstraction layered on top of the Phase 0 webhook fanout. Sinks subscribe to the orchestrator event bus (`wireNotificationSinks` in `events.ts`, structurally parallel to `wireWebhookFanout`) and deliver each filtered event directly to a destination (Slack incoming webhook for v1) with optional `wrap_response` envelope formatting. Failures emit `notification.delivery.failed` for operator visibility; sinks never retry (durable delivery is the Phase 0 webhook fanout's job).

**Sink config** lives in `harness.config.json` under `notifications.sinks[]`:

```jsonc
{
  "notifications": {
    "sinks": [
      {
        "id": "team-alerts",
        "kind": "slack",
        "events": ["maintenance.error", "interaction.created"],
        "wrap_response": true,
        "config": { "webhookUrlEnv": "HARNESS_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL" },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

`webhookUrlEnv` names the env var holding the Slack incoming-webhook URL (must match `https://hooks.slack.com/`); the URL never lands in the config file. `wrap_response: true` wraps each `GatewayEvent` into a `NotificationEnvelope` (six fields: `title`, `summary`, `severity`, optional `actions[]`, `permalink?`, `correlationId?`) before delivery; `false` delivers the raw event.

**CLI.** `harness notifications test <sink-id>` synthesizes a `notification.test` event and routes it through the named sink. Used after first-config to verify the env var is set and the URL works; also the Phase 3 phase-readiness gate for "external test consumer exists."

**Layer compliance.** Contract types in `packages/types/src/notifications.ts`; concrete sinks in `packages/orchestrator/src/notifications/`; config loader in `packages/core/src/notifications/config-loader.ts`; CLI in `packages/cli/src/commands/notifications/`. No cross-layer leak (orchestrator never imports core/cli; core's loader uses only types).

See [`docs/knowledge/orchestrator/notification-sinks.md`](docs/knowledge/orchestrator/notification-sinks.md) for the business-process node and [ADR 0013](docs/knowledge/decisions/0013-notification-sink-interface.md) for the contract decisions.

### Doctor Hardening (Hermes Phase 3 / A7)

`harness doctor` runs four new check classes alongside the legacy presence checks (Node, slash commands, MCP, integrations registry). All are synchronous and file-IO only; outbound HTTP probes are explicitly out of scope per [ADR 0014](docs/knowledge/decisions/0014-doctor-live-state-checks.md).

- **`checkLivePings`** — env-var presence + shape for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (prefix `sk-ant-`), `OPENAI_API_KEY` (prefix `sk-`), `GITHUB_TOKEN` (length ≥ 30). Absent → `info`; malformed → `warn`; well-shaped → `pass`.
- **`checkHookValidity`** — for each file under `.harness/hooks/`: JSON parse or shebang detection. Empty file → `fail`; missing shebang → `warn`; parses OK → `pass`. Directory absent → single `info`.
- **`checkBaselineFreshness`** — mtime check for `.harness/arch/baselines.json`, `benchmark-baselines.json`, `coverage-baselines.json`. < 30 days → `pass`; 30–89 → `warn`; ≥ 90 → `fail`; absent → `info`. Fix hints point at the canonical refresh commands.
- **`checkSessionCorruption`** — parse the five most-recent `session-summary.json` files under `.harness/sessions/`. All parse → `pass`; some malformed → `warn`; all malformed → `fail`; no sessions → `info`.

`runDoctor(cwd)` remains synchronous and the JSON output shape is additive (existing check names unchanged; new checks add `live-pings-*`, `hook-validity-*`, `baseline-freshness-*`, `session-corruption` entries). See [`docs/knowledge/cli/doctor-hardening.md`](docs/knowledge/cli/doctor-hardening.md).

### Skill Proposals (Hermes Phase 4)

Agents can emit skill candidates — either a fully-formed new skill or a unified-diff refinement against an existing one — through the `emit_skill_proposal` MCP tool (`packages/cli/src/mcp/tools/skill-proposal.ts`, tier `standard`). The tool writes a strict-validated JSON record to `.harness/proposals/<id>.json` and returns immediately; agents are never blocked on review.

**Storage + schema.** Proposals are validated through `SkillProposalSchema` (`packages/types/src/proposals.ts`). The schema enforces a kind ↔ content invariant: `new-skill` requires `skillYaml` + `skillMd`; `refinement` requires `targetSkill` + unified-diff `diff`. Status transitions are `open → gate-running | gate-failed → approved | rejected`.

**Soundness gate.** Reviewers trigger `POST /api/v1/proposals/<id>/run-gate` (UI button or `harness proposals approve` indirectly). The gate (`packages/orchestrator/src/proposals/gate.ts`) runs mechanical structural checks today — kebab-case name, parseable skill.yaml, SKILL.md size bounds, unified-diff well-formedness — and persists findings. A future `harness:soundness-review --mode skill` follow-up replaces the mechanical checks without changing the integration surface (ADR 0016).

**Promotion.** With a clean gate fresh within 24h, `POST /api/v1/proposals/<id>/approve` invokes `promote()` (`packages/orchestrator/src/proposals/promote.ts`) which writes `agents/skills/claude-code/<name>/{skill.yaml,SKILL.md}` with `provenance: agent-proposed` and `originatingProposalId: <id>`. Refinements stamp provenance on the existing target after verifying the reviewer applied the diff. The slash-command generator regenerates per-host plugin manifests on next run.

**Provenance.** Every skill now carries `provenance: community | agent-proposed | user-authored`. The one-shot `proposal-provenance-backfill` maintenance task (`harness backfill-skill-provenance`) stamps `user-authored` on every catalog skill missing the field; idempotent re-runs are no-ops. Scheduled cron is Feb 31 so the scheduler never fires it; operators trigger via dashboard or CLI.

**Surfaces.** MCP tool `emit_skill_proposal`. CLI `harness proposals list|show|approve|reject` and `harness backfill-skill-provenance`. Dashboard page `/s/proposals` (`packages/dashboard/src/client/pages/Proposals.tsx`). Seven gateway routes under `/api/v1/proposals/*` registered in `V1_BRIDGE_ROUTES`; reads use `read-status`, mutations require the new `manage-proposals` scope (ADR 0017). Events `proposal.created`, `proposal.approved`, `proposal.rejected` fan out via the Phase 0 webhook bus and Phase 3 notification sinks; envelope derivers in `notifications/envelope.ts` render them with appropriate severities.

See [`docs/knowledge/cli/skill-proposals.md`](docs/knowledge/cli/skill-proposals.md) and [`docs/knowledge/cli/skill-provenance.md`](docs/knowledge/cli/skill-provenance.md). ADRs: [0016](docs/knowledge/decisions/0016-skill-proposal-workflow.md), [0017](docs/knowledge/decisions/0017-manage-proposals-scope.md).

### Dashboard Package

`packages/dashboard/` is a React + Hono full-stack app providing a web-based project health dashboard.

**Client** (`src/client/`): React SPA with 12 pages (Adoption, Analyze, Attention, DecayTrends, Graph, Health, Impact, Maintenance, Orchestrator, Roadmap, Streams, Traceability), reusable components (KpiCard, GanttChart, DependencyGraph, BlastRadiusGraph, ProgressChart, ActionButton, StaleIndicator, Layout), and SSE-based live data hooks (`useSSE`, `useApi`).

**Server** (`src/server/`): Hono HTTP server with SSE connection manager running a shared polling loop. Routes: actions, actions-claim-file-less, adoption, ci, decay-trends, graph, health, health-check, impact, overview, roadmap, sse, traceability. Data gatherers: adoption, anomalies, arch, blast-radius, ci, decay-trends, entry-points, graph, health, perf, roadmap, security, traceability.

### Orchestrator Intelligence Integration

The orchestrator depends on `@harness-engineering/intelligence` for persona-aware dispatch. The `IntelligencePipelineRunner` (`packages/orchestrator/src/intelligence/pipeline-runner.ts`) orchestrates: spec enrichment (SEL), complexity scoring (CML), pre-execution simulation (PESL), analysis archiving, and auto-publishing. It imports `weightedRecommendPersona` and `refreshProfiles` from the intelligence package to route issues to the best-fit persona based on specialization profiles. Execution outcomes feed back into effectiveness scoring to improve future routing.

### Orchestrator Maintenance Tasks

`packages/orchestrator/src/maintenance/task-registry.ts` defines 22 built-in scheduled tasks across four execution strategies:

- **mechanical-ai (7):** `arch-violations`, `dep-violations`, `doc-drift`, `security-findings`, `entropy`, `traceability`, `cross-check` — run a check command first, dispatch an AI agent only if fixable findings exist.
- **pure-ai (4):** `dead-code`, `dependency-health`, `hotspot-remediation`, `security-review` — always dispatch an AI agent on schedule.
- **report-only (7):** `perf-check`, `decay-trends`, `project-health`, `stale-constraints`, `graph-refresh`, `product-pulse`, `compound-candidates` — run a command and record metrics; never create branches or PRs. Honors a JSON status contract (`{status, candidatesFound?, error?, reason?}`) emitted by the new `--non-interactive` CLIs; legacy free-form output falls through to `success`.
  - `product-pulse` (daily 8am, gated on `pulse.enabled`) — generates `docs/pulse-reports/` via `harness pulse run --non-interactive`.
  - `compound-candidates` (Mondays 9am) — surfaces undocumented learnings into `docs/solutions/.candidates/` via `harness compound scan-candidates --non-interactive`. Scheduled at 9am rather than 6am to avoid collision with the existing Monday 6am block (cross-check, perf-check, traceability).
- **housekeeping (4):** `session-cleanup`, `perf-baselines`, `main-sync`, `proposal-provenance-backfill` (one-shot, manual trigger via Feb 31 cron) — run a mechanical command directly, no AI, no PR.

The dashboard `Maintenance` page renders a candidate-count badge on `compound-candidates` history rows when `findings > 0`.

#### Custom Maintenance Tasks (Hermes Phase 2)

`MaintenanceConfig.customTasks: Record<string, CustomTaskDefinition>` extends the scheduler beyond the 21 built-ins (see [docs/knowledge/orchestrator/custom-maintenance-jobs.md](docs/knowledge/orchestrator/custom-maintenance-jobs.md) and ADR [0015](docs/knowledge/decisions/0015-hermes-phase-2-custom-maintenance-jobs.md)). Custom tasks honor the same 4-task-type taxonomy and gain five optional fields:

- `checkScript: { path, args?, parseStdoutJson?, timeoutMs? }` — arbitrary executable (mutually-exclusive with `checkCommand`). The runner parses the last non-empty stdout line as a JSON envelope `{status: 'ok'|'findings'|'skip'|'error', findings?, wakeAgent?, message?, outputs?}`; falls back to the heuristic regex on absence.
- `contextFrom: string[]` — upstream task IDs whose latest persisted output is injected into the agent prompt as `## Upstream context`. Cycles rejected at config-load by `validateCustomTasks`; stale entries (older than `contextFromMaxAgeMinutes`, default 1440) get a `[stale: omitted]` marker.
- `inlineSkills: string[]` + `inlineSkillsBudgetTokens` (default 8000) — skill markdown bodies inlined under `## Reference skills` with a char-count budget that warns-then-truncates skill-granularly.
- `outputRetention: { runs?, maxAgeDays? }` — overrides the default 50-run / 30-day retention bounds.

`RunResult.origin: RunOrigin` is a discriminated provenance tag (`'cron' | 'cli' | { kind: 'api', tokenName } | { kind: 'chain', upstreamTaskId }`) set by the entry point and never configurable. `TaskOutputStore` persists one JSON file per run at `.harness/maintenance/<task-id>/outputs/<iso>.json` (one-file-per-run trades inode count for clarity; retention-bounded).

CLI: `harness maintenance list` shows the resolved task list (built-in + custom); `harness maintenance show <task-id> --limit N` reads from the output store. The `harness maintenance run <task-id>` subcommand and the `/api/v1/jobs/maintenance/{taskId}/trigger` API are deferred to a follow-up alongside the Phase 0 Gateway API contracts.

#### Pre-launch OSV Malware Guard (Hermes Phase 2 / A8)

`harness mcp-guard check [--strict] [--json]` reads `.mcp.json`, iterates `mcpServers`, extracts `npx <pkg>[@<version>]` arguments, and queries OSV.dev for `MAL-*` advisories. Exits `2` on any malicious match — suitable as a `pre-mcp-launch` hook from host plugin manifests. Default posture is fail-open (network failures warn-and-continue); `--strict` reverses to fail-closed. The advisory cache lives at `.harness/cache/osv/<ecosystem>-<name>@<version>.json` with a 24h TTL (`harness mcp-guard cache clear` invalidates). The client is exported from `@harness-engineering/core` as `createOsvClient`. See [docs/knowledge/cli/pre-launch-osv-guard.md](docs/knowledge/cli/pre-launch-osv-guard.md).

#### Disk Hygiene (Hermes Phase 2 / A9)

`harness cleanup-sessions` (no flags) continues to sweep only `.harness/sessions/` at the 24h TTL. New flags `--all` / `--include <list>` / `--exclude <list>` extend the sweep across registered targets: `sessions` (24h), `cache` (7d), `maintenance` (30d), `dashboard-state` (14d), `snapshots` (14d), `analyzer-output` (7d). Per-target TTLs are overridable via the new `cleanup.ttlHours: Record<string, number>` config section. Unknown subdirectories of `.harness/` are preserved.

### Solutions and Pulse Reports

Two artifact roots support the feedback-loops feature:

- `docs/solutions/<track>/<category>/<slug>.md` — solved-problem playbooks written
  via `/harness:compound`. Tracks: `bug-track/`, `knowledge-track/`. See
  `docs/conventions/compound-vs-knowledge-pipeline.md` for category guidance.
- `docs/pulse-reports/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md` — daily single-page pulse reports
  written by the `product-pulse` maintenance task. Read these when prioritizing.

The boundary with `harness-knowledge-pipeline` is documented in
ADR-0023 (`docs/knowledge/decisions/0023-compound-vs-knowledge-pipeline-boundary.md`):
compound captures post-mortem playbooks; the pipeline extracts structural facts
from code. Both `product-pulse` and `compound-candidates` are registered as
`report-only` maintenance tasks (see the orchestrator maintenance section).

### Graph Subsystems

In addition to the core graph store and ContextQL engine:

- `query/Traceability.ts` — Traces requirement-to-code/test coverage with confidence levels and EARS pattern detection
- `ingest/RequirementIngestor.ts` — Ingests requirements from spec markdown sections (Observable Truths, Success Criteria, Acceptance Criteria)
- `blast-radius/CascadeSimulator.ts` — Probability-weighted BFS simulating cascading failure propagation from a source node
- `blast-radius/CompositeProbabilityStrategy.ts` — Blends edge type weight (50%), change frequency (30%), and coupling strength (20%) for failure propagation probability
- `benchmarks/queries.bench.ts` — Vitest benchmarks for graph queries with medium (100-node) synthetic fixtures

### Types Package Detail

Beyond the core Result, Config, and ValidationError types:

- `workflow.ts` — Types for multi-skill workflows with step dependencies, gates, and outcomes
- `usage.ts` — UsageRecord composition of TokenUsage with cache tokens, model, and cost tracking
- `tracker-sync.ts` — ExternalTicket/ExternalTicketState types for bidirectional tracker integration
- `session-state.ts` — SessionSectionName union type and session entry lifecycle
- `ci.ts` — CICheckName, CICheckStatus, and CICheckIssue types for CI check reporting

### Unified Knowledge Graph

The `packages/graph` package provides a graph-based context system that unifies code structure, organizational knowledge, and external data into a single queryable model. It powers context assembly, entropy detection, constraint enforcement, and skill execution across the entire toolkit. Key components: LokiJS graph store, ContextQL query engine, FusionLayer (keyword + semantic search), code/git/knowledge ingestion pipelines, CascadeSimulator (probabilistic failure propagation via `compute_blast_radius` MCP tool), and 4 external connectors (Jira, Slack, Confluence, CI).

### Integration Phase

The integration phase (INTEGRATE) is a verification gate between Verification and Code Review in the standard workflow. It confirms that planned integration tasks -- wiring, knowledge materialization, and documentation updates -- actually completed after execution.

**Position in workflow:** `VERIFY -> INTEGRATE -> REVIEW`

**Three sub-phases:**

- **WIRE** (all tiers): Verifies barrel exports are current (`pnpm run generate:barrels:check`), `harness validate` passes, and entry points are reachable. Always runs, even for small changes.
- **MATERIALIZE** (medium + large tiers): Verifies ADRs are written for architectural decisions, knowledge graph is enriched with decision nodes, and documentation tasks are complete.
- **UPDATE** (medium + large tiers): Verifies roadmap sync, changelog entries, and spec cross-references.

**Tiered rigor model:**

| Tier       | Signal                                            | Integration Requirements                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **small**  | Bug fix, config change, < 3 files, no new exports | WIRE only (default checks always run)                                  |
| **medium** | New feature, new exports, 3-15 files              | WIRE + project updates (roadmap, changelog, graph enrichment)          |
| **large**  | New package, new skill, architectural change      | WIRE + project updates + knowledge materialization (ADRs, doc updates) |

The tier is estimated during planning and confirmed from execution results. The effective tier is `max(planned, derived)` -- the higher tier always wins.

**Skill:** `harness-integration` (Tier 1 workflow skill). Invoked via `/harness:integration` or dispatched by autopilot at the INTEGRATE state.

**ADRs:** Architectural decisions are recorded as markdown files in `docs/knowledge/decisions/` using sequential 4-digit numbering (e.g., `0001-decision-name.md`). ADRs are ingested by the knowledge pipeline as queryable `decision` graph nodes.

### Skill Tier System

Skills are classified into three tiers to preserve context. Only Tier 1 and Tier 2 skills are registered as slash commands; Tier 3 skills are discoverable via the `search_skills` MCP tool.

- **Tier 1 (Workflow, 14 skills):** Always-loaded slash commands for core workflow — brainstorming, planning, execution, autopilot, tdd, debugging, refactoring, skill-authoring, onboarding, initialize-project, add-component, harness-integration, harness-router, initialize-test-suite-project.
- **Tier 2 (Maintenance, 24 skills):** Always-loaded slash commands for project health — integrity, verify, code-review, release-readiness, docs-pipeline, codebase-cleanup, enforce-architecture, detect-doc-drift, cleanup-dead-code, dependency-health, hotspot-detector, security-scan, perf, impact-analysis, test-advisor, soundness-review, architecture-advisor, roadmap, verification, supply-chain-audit, roadmap-pilot, harness-compound, harness-knowledge-pipeline, harness-pulse.
- **Tier 3 (Catalog, 697 skills):** Discoverable on demand via `search_skills`. Includes domain skills (API design, database, deployment, containerization, etc.), design skills, i18n, and specialized testing.
- **Internal (6 skills):** Dependency-only, never surfaced. Invoked by other skills as part of pipelines.

The `search_skills` MCP tool (`packages/cli/src/mcp/tools/search-skills.ts`) queries a merged index of bundled + community skills. The index uses hash-based staleness detection. An intelligent dispatcher (`packages/cli/src/skill/dispatcher.ts`) suggests relevant Tier 3 skills when Tier 1 workflow skills start. Stack profile detection (`packages/cli/src/skill/stack-profile.ts`) identifies project technologies to bias suggestions. Configuration overrides in `harness.config.json` support `skills.alwaysSuggest`, `skills.neverSuggest`, and `skills.tierOverrides`.

### Community Skill Registry

The `@harness-skills/*` npm namespace enables publishing, discovering, and installing community skills. Key commands: `harness install`, `harness uninstall`, `harness skill search`, `harness skill create`, `harness skill publish`. Supports local installs (`--from ./path`), private registries (`--registry <url>`), and `.npmrc` auth tokens. Skills are pure content packages (no runtime code). Discovery priority: project-local > community > bundled.

Implementation in `packages/cli/src/registry/` and `packages/cli/src/commands/skill/`. See the [Skill Marketplace Guide](./docs/guides/skill-marketplace.md) for full usage, architecture, and examples.

### Project Roadmap

The project roadmap lives at `docs/roadmap.md` and tracks features across milestones with statuses (`backlog`, `planned`, `in-progress`, `done`, `blocked`). Core implementation in `packages/core/src/roadmap/` provides `parseRoadmap`, `serializeRoadmap`, and `syncRoadmap`. The `manage_roadmap` MCP tool (`packages/cli/src/mcp/tools/roadmap.ts`) exposes CRUD operations: `show`, `add`, `update`, `remove`, `query`, `sync`. The `harness-roadmap` skill provides interactive workflows: `--create`, `--add`, `--sync`, `--edit`, `--query`. Roadmap sync respects a "human-always-wins" rule — manually edited statuses are preserved unless `force_sync` is set. The orchestrator adapter (`packages/orchestrator/src/tracker/adapters/roadmap.ts`) maps roadmap features to the internal Issue model for agent orchestration.

**External tracker sync** — Bidirectional sync between `roadmap.md` and GitHub Issues via `TrackerSyncAdapter` (`packages/core/src/roadmap/tracker-sync.ts`). The `GitHubIssuesSyncAdapter` (`packages/core/src/roadmap/adapters/github-issues.ts`) uses label-based status disambiguation for the open/closed limitation. The sync engine (`packages/core/src/roadmap/sync-engine.ts`) provides `syncToExternal` (push planning fields), `syncFromExternal` (pull execution fields with directional guard via `status-rank.ts`), and `fullSync` (mutex-serialized read-push-pull-write cycle). Configuration via `roadmap.tracker` in `harness.config.json` (validated by `TrackerConfigSchema` in `packages/cli/src/config/schema.ts`). Auto-sync fires on 6 state transitions via `triggerExternalSync` in `packages/cli/src/mcp/tools/roadmap-auto-sync.ts`.

**File-less mode (opt-in)** — Setting `roadmap.mode: "file-less"` in `harness.config.json` makes the configured GitHub Issues tracker the canonical roadmap; `docs/roadmap.md` must not exist. All consumers (CLI, dashboard, MCP `manage_roadmap`, orchestrator, `harness:roadmap-pilot`) branch on the mode flag at runtime. Migrate with `harness roadmap migrate --to=file-less`. See `docs/guides/roadmap-sync.md` §"File-less mode" and ADRs 0008–0010 for the design rationale. See [docs/changes/roadmap-tracker-only/migration.md](docs/changes/roadmap-tracker-only/migration.md) for the operator walkthrough.

**Auto-pick pilot** — The `harness-roadmap-pilot` skill (`agents/skills/claude-code/harness-roadmap-pilot/`) selects the next highest-impact unblocked item using a two-tier sort: explicit priority first (P0–P3), then weighted score (position 0.5, dependents 0.3, affinity 0.2). Scoring algorithm and `assignFeature` function in `packages/core/src/roadmap/pilot-scoring.ts`. Routes to `harness:brainstorming` (no spec) or `harness:autopilot` (spec exists). Assignment updates the feature's `Assignee` field, appends to the `## Assignment History` section, and syncs to the external tracker.

### Monorepo Structure Benefits

- **Shared Dependencies** - One pnpm-lock.yaml ensures consistency
- **Unified Tooling** - Same linting, formatting, and test configuration
- **Coordinated Changes** - Easy to update multiple packages together
- **Turborepo Caching** - Faster builds with smart caching

### Documentation-First Approach

All architectural decisions must be documented:

1. **Design Documents** - Explain the "why" before implementing
2. **Architecture Decisions** - Record key choices in `/docs/standard/`
3. **Implementation Plans** - Track execution in `/docs/plans/`
4. **Specifications** - Detailed technical specs in `/docs/changes/`
5. **Guides** - How-to documentation for common tasks

This creates a permanent record that AI agents can access and understand.

2. **Second**: [Seven Core Principles](./docs/standard/principles.md) - Understanding how it works
3. **Third**: [Getting Started Guide](./docs/guides/getting-started.md) - Practical setup
4. **Reference**: [Implementation Guide](./docs/standard/implementation.md) - Detailed guidance
5. **Context**: This file (AGENTS.md) - Navigation and quick reference

## Conventions

### Code Style

- **TypeScript Strict Mode** - All code compiles with `strict: true`
- **ESLint** - Configured in `eslint.config.js` for code quality rules
- **Prettier** - Auto-formatting with rules in `.prettierrc.json`
  - 2-space indentation
  - Single quotes for strings
  - Trailing commas where valid
  - Line length: 100 characters (practical limit)

### Code Organization

- **Barrel Exports** - Each package has `src/index.ts` that re-exports public API
- **Type-Safe Code** - No `any` types unless absolutely necessary with `// @ts-ignore` comments
- **Clear Imports** - Explicit imports from package exports, not internal paths

### Commit Message Format

Follow **Conventional Commits** (see Git Workflow section above):

```
type(scope): brief description under 50 chars

Optional longer body explaining the "why" and "what" of the change.
Keep lines under 72 characters for readability.

Closes #123  # Optional reference to related issues
```

### Documentation Standards

When writing documentation:

1. **Be Specific** - Explain decisions, not just facts
2. **Include Examples** - Code examples for technical decisions
3. **Link References** - Link to related docs
4. **Update AGENTS.md** - Add new docs to the navigation
5. **Explain the Why** - Focus on reasoning, not just implementation

Example documentation template:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Overview

One-sentence description of what this is and why it exists.

## Design

Detailed explanation of the design and key decisions.

## Implementation

How it works technically with code examples.

## Examples

```

### Testing Approach

- **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests** - Test package interactions
- **Test Coverage** - Aim for high coverage of critical paths
- **Descriptive Names** - Test names explain what is being tested

Test file locations:

- Core code: `src/module.ts`
- Tests: `tests/module.test.ts`

## Context for AI Agents

### Our Approach to AI Development

This project is **specifically designed** for AI agents to work on it effectively:

1. **Documentation is Law** - Decisions are recorded, not assumed
2. **Explicit Over Implicit** - Clear patterns and constraints guide work
3. **Mechanical Validation** - Rules are enforced by code, not hope
4. **Self-Verification** - Agents can run tests and validate their work
5. **Context-Dense** - All information needed is in the repository

### Principles to Follow

When working on this project, AI agents should:

1. **Read AGENTS.md First** - Understand the project context
2. **Check Related Documentation** - Follow links to understand decisions
3. **Follow Conventions Strictly** - Code style, commit messages, structure
4. **Write Tests** - Verify new code before committing
5. **Update Documentation** - Keep docs in sync with code changes
6. **Self-Review** - Run tests, check formatting, verify types before submitting
7. **Be Specific in PRs** - Explain the why, not just the what
8. **Respect Boundaries** - Stay within architectural constraints

### Harness Engineering Principles

The project embodies these core principles:

1. **Context Engineering** - All knowledge lives in git (this AGENTS.md, architectural docs, specs)
2. **Architectural Rigidity** - Layered architecture with mechanical constraints prevents bad patterns
3. **Agent Feedback Loop** - Self-review, peer review, testing all happen before human review
4. **Entropy Management** - Documentation must stay in sync with code
5. **Depth-First Implementation** - Complete features fully before starting new ones
6. **Measurable Success** - Track metrics: agent autonomy, harness coverage, context density

### Error Handling Pattern

Always use Result types for operations that may fail:

```typescript
import type { Result, ValidationError } from '@harness-engineering/core';
import { createError } from '@harness-engineering/core';

export function validateConfig(data: unknown): Result<Config, ValidationError> {
  if (!isValidConfig(data)) {
    return {
      ok: false,
      error: createError<ValidationError>('VALIDATION_FAILED', 'Invalid config'),
    };
  }
  return { ok: true, value: data as Config };
}
```

This makes error handling explicit and type-safe.
