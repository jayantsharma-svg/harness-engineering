## Decisions waiting for you (read `AMENDMENTS.md` for full detail)

**Update (second pass, 2026-05-23):** items 1-3 and 5 below are RESOLVED in the second commit batch. Only architectural decisions inherent to Phase 1 remain.

1. ~~**Skill source-location amendment.**~~ ✓ RESOLVED — both spec File-layout sections rewritten with corrected paths (`agents/skills/claude-code/` for skill markdown, `packages/{audit,design-craft}/` new packages for impl code, `packages/cli/src/mcp/tools/` for MCP tools, `agents/skills/shared/design-knowledge/` for catalogs).

2. ~~**Visual pipeline Q3 go/no-go for #6.**~~ ✓ RESOLVED — playwright MCP server (`mcp__playwright__browser_*`) used instead of npm dep. Confirmed available in this environment. Spec render-pipeline section rewritten. No new install required; users configure the MCP server one-time.

3. ~~**ADR numbering correction in spec text.**~~ ✓ RESOLVED — #6 proposal.md now references ADRs 0018-0021 with hyperlinks.

4. **`BenchmarkScore.overall` aggregation rule.** Deferred to Phase 1's first task. Spike recommendation: equal-weight mean with config override + `min` for confidence. Required for SC #34 (fixpoint detection).

5. ~~**Pre-existing ADR duplicate numbers (0003-0007 range).**~~ ✓ DOCUMENTED — ADR 0022 filed with renumbering plan (second-of-pair → 0023-0027). Execution is a separate follow-up PR (file moves + reference updates).

~~**New remaining decision**~~ ✓ RESOLVED:
6. ~~**`packages/audit/` and `packages/design-craft/` as new packages, or co-locate under `packages/cli/src/`?**~~ **Decided: co-locate under `packages/cli/src/audit/component-anatomy/` and `packages/cli/src/design-craft/`.** Rationale: only consumer is the CLI's MCP tool surface; precedent set by packages/cli/src/skill/ (148 KB substantial subsystem hosted inside CLI without packaging); new-package overhead (tsconfig, build pipeline, release config, dep wiring) not justified for a CLI-MCP-driven concern; extraction to a separate package later is straightforward if multi-consumer use emerges. Both spec File-layout sections updated to reflect this as the primary path (no "alternative" escape-hatch language remaining).

**All amendments resolved. No remaining architectural decisions before Phase 1 implementation work begins.**

Two narrow Phase-1-first-task spike items remain (per A4 + A5 in AMENDMENTS):
- Lock `BenchmarkScore.overall` aggregation rule (equal-weight mean + min for confidence per spike recommendation)
- Decide where to encode the Tabs trigger/panel pairing invariant (runner responsibility per spike recommendation)

Neither is a blocker for starting Phase 1; both are sub-task-level decisions that surface during the first work, not architectural gates.

## What's NOT done (deliberately)

- **No Phase 1+ implementation code.** Both Phase 1s are HIGH complexity per the plans (22 and 18 engineering tasks respectively). The skill scaffolding is the only "code" landed — and it's just SKILL.md + skill.yaml. Tree-sitter integration, AST parser, MCP tool implementations, graph adapter extensions — none of that is written. Those need:
  - The architectural amendments above resolved
  - Real time per task with verify gates
  - Probably your supervision at APPROVE_PLAN gates (every Phase 1+ trips task-count-15 signal)

- **No autopilot end-to-end runs.** Discovered during this session: autopilot requires the primary session, not a subagent. If you want to run autopilots, invoke `/harness:autopilot docs/changes/design-pipeline/audit-component-anatomy/proposal.md` from your top-level conversation.

- **No branch push to origin.** Branch `feat/design-pipeline-decomposition` is local only. Push when you've reviewed.

- **No PR opened.** Deliberately your call.

## Next move options

**A) Review and merge.** Inspect commits, push to origin, open PR.

**B) Resolve amendments first.** Apply path corrections to both spec files + decide visual-pipeline path for #6 + decide aggregation rules. ~1 hour of focused editing. Then planning phase becomes accurate.

**C) Kick off real Phase 1 implementation.** From your primary session, run `/harness:autopilot` on one or both specs. Expect APPROVE_PLAN pauses on Phase 1+. Plan to be present for those gates.

**D) Pick up #0 brand-guidelines decision.** Smaller, time-bounded work (one ADR doc). Unblocks sub-project #3. Could be done in 1-2 hours.

## Validate status

(The Hermes link issue that was failing every validate this morning is fixed in commit `87ef5524`.)
