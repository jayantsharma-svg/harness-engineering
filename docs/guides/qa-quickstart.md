## What Is Harness Engineering?

Harness Engineering is a toolkit that makes AI coding agents reliable through **mechanical enforcement**. Instead of relying on prompts, conventions, and hope, harness encodes your project's architectural decisions, quality standards, and testing requirements as machine-checkable constraints. Every rule is validated on every change.

For QA, this means:

- **Automated quality gates** that run before code is even merged
- **AI-powered code review** that catches bugs, security issues, and architectural violations
- **Graph-based test intelligence** that tells you exactly which tests to run for any change
- **Structured testing workflows** that guide agents (and humans) through E2E, integration, load, mutation, visual regression, and property-based testing
- **Continuous validation** that keeps documentation, architecture, and code in sync

Harness operates through **slash commands** (e.g., `/harness:code-review`) in your AI coding tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor), **CLI skills** invoked via `harness skill run <name>`, and **CLI commands** for scripts and CI pipelines.

> **Slash commands vs. skills:** Not every skill has a registered slash command. Core workflow skills (review, verify, tdd, etc.) are slash commands you can type directly. Domain-specific testing skills (e2e, mutation-test, load-testing, etc.) are invoked via `harness skill run <name>` or by asking your AI agent to run them. Both work the same way — the difference is just how you invoke them.

## Why QA Should Care

| Traditional QA Pain Point                           | How Harness Solves It                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Which tests should I run for this PR?"             | `/harness:test-advisor` analyzes the diff and tells you exactly which tests to run, prioritized into 3 tiers                       |
| "Did the dev actually test this?"                   | `/harness:verification` checks at 3 tiers: file EXISTS, code is SUBSTANTIVE (not stubs), and features are WIRED into the system    |
| "I keep finding the same types of bugs in review"   | `/harness:code-review` runs a 7-phase pipeline with parallel AI agents that check for bugs, security, architecture, and compliance |
| "Our tests pass but don't catch real bugs"          | `harness-mutation-test` skill introduces deliberate code mutations to verify your tests actually catch real bugs                   |
| "Security issues slip through to production"        | `harness check-security` scans for secrets, injection, XSS, weak crypto, path traversal, and more — mechanically, every time       |
| "We don't know if our tests cover the right things" | The knowledge graph maps every file to its tests, showing coverage gaps and blast radius for changes                               |
| "Regression testing takes too long"                 | Test advisor + graph-based prioritization lets you run only the tests that matter, cutting suite time dramatically                 |
| "Flaky E2E tests block our pipeline"                | `harness-e2e` skill includes a dedicated Phase 4 for systematic flakiness detection and remediation                                |
| "Docs say one thing, code does another"             | `/harness:detect-doc-drift` mechanically compares documentation against code and flags drift                                       |

## Getting Started (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- An AI coding agent: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Cursor
- Git

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @harness-engineering/cli
harness setup
```

This installs the CLI and configures slash commands, MCP server, and agent personas for your detected AI clients. After this, `/harness:*` commands are available in every conversation.

### Verify Your Project

If your project already uses harness:

```
/harness:verify
```

This runs all mechanical checks in one pass — configuration, dependencies, lint, typecheck, tests — and gives you a binary pass/fail.

If your project doesn't use harness yet, initialize it:

```
/harness:initialize-project
```

This walks you through setup interactively and scaffolds everything. For test suites (Playwright API suites, E2E/UI suites, or shared test libraries), use the test-suite variant instead, which adds archetype selection, shared-library-vs-scaffold decision, layer variants, tag taxonomy, reporter stack, and a custom report:

```
/harness:initialize-test-suite-project
```

### Build the Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph powers test intelligence, impact analysis, and blast radius estimation:

```bash
harness scan
```

This builds a structural graph from your code, git history, and documentation. It enables the most powerful QA features like test advisor and impact analysis.

## Day-to-Day QA Workflows

### 1. Reviewing a Pull Request

**The old way:** Read the diff, mentally trace dependencies, check if tests exist, maybe run some tests locally.

**The harness way:**

```
/harness:code-review
```

This runs a **7-phase pipeline**:

1. **GATE** — Checks if the PR is eligible for review
2. **MECHANICAL** — Runs lint, typecheck, tests, security scan. If any fail, it reports and stops — no point reviewing code that doesn't compile.
3. **CONTEXT** — Assembles context per review domain at a 1:1 ratio (200-line diff = ~200 lines of surrounding context from imports, tests, specs, types)
4. **FAN-OUT** — Dispatches parallel review agents for compliance, bugs, security, and architecture
5. **VALIDATE** — Filters out duplicates and mechanical-only issues
6. **DEDUP+MERGE** — Groups findings, assigns severity
7. **OUTPUT** — Delivers a structured report with evidence-based findings

Every finding includes **file:line**, **severity** (critical/important/suggestion), **rationale**, and **suggested fix**. No vague "consider adding validation" — the review points to specific lines.

**Rigor levels:**

- `--fast` — Quick pass for low-risk PRs
- (default) — Standard review
- `--thorough` — Full roster with meta-judge for high-risk changes
- `--deep` — Adds security threat modeling

**Post to GitHub:**

```
/harness:code-review --comment
```

This posts inline comments directly on the PR.

---

### 2. Deciding What Tests to Run

**The old way:** Run the whole suite. Wait 20 minutes. Or guess which tests matter.

**The harness way:**

```
/harness:test-advisor
```

The test advisor:

1. **PARSES** the diff to identify changed files
2. **DISCOVERS** related tests via the knowledge graph (direct imports, transitive imports, co-change history)
3. **PRIORITIZES** tests into 3 tiers:

| Tier                    | Priority             | What It Catches                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1 — Must Run**   | Direct test coverage | Tests that directly import changed files       |
| **Tier 2 — Should Run** | Transitive coverage  | Tests one hop away — catches indirect breakage |
| **Tier 3 — Could Run**  | Related              | Same module, co-change history                 |

Output includes **ready-to-run commands**:

```
### Quick Run Command
npx vitest run tests/services/auth.test.ts tests/types/user.test.ts

### Full Run Command (all tiers)
npx vitest run tests/services/auth.test.ts tests/types/user.test.ts tests/routes/login.test.ts tests/integration/auth-flow.test.ts
```

It also **flags coverage gaps**: "No tests found for src/services/auth.ts — consider adding tests before merging."

> **Pro tip:** If no knowledge graph exists, the test advisor falls back to naming conventions, import parsing, and git co-change analysis (~80% coverage). Run `harness scan` to get the full graph-enhanced analysis.

---

### 3. Writing New Tests

Harness provides specialized skills for different types of tests:

#### Test-Driven Development (Unit Tests)

```
/harness:tdd
```

Guides you through the red-green-refactor cycle with mechanical enforcement. Write a failing test, implement the code, verify it passes, refactor.

#### Integration Tests

```bash
harness skill run harness-integration-test
```

Walks you through:

1. **DISCOVER** — Maps service boundaries and dependencies, identifies coverage gaps
2. **MOCK** — Configures test doubles (Testcontainers, in-memory DBs, mock services)
3. **IMPLEMENT** — Writes API tests, contract tests, repository tests
4. **VALIDATE** — Runs tests, checks contracts, verifies error scenarios

Supports supertest, Pact, Testcontainers, and consumer-driven contracts.

#### Property-Based Tests

```bash
harness skill run harness-property-test
```

For functions with large input spaces. Instead of writing specific examples, you define **properties** (e.g., "serializing then deserializing always returns the original") and the framework generates thousands of random inputs to verify.

Great for: parsers, serializers, validators, sorting algorithms, data transformations.

---

### 4. Running Security Checks

#### Quick Mechanical Scan

```
/harness:security-scan
```

Scans for 11+ pattern categories:

- **Secrets**: API keys, tokens, passwords
- **Injection**: SQL injection, command injection, eval/Function
- **XSS**: innerHTML, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, document.write
- **Cryptography**: Weak hashing, hardcoded keys
- **Path traversal**: Directory traversal in file operations
- **Network**: CORS wildcards, disabled TLS, hardcoded HTTP
- **Agent config**: Unicode detection, wildcard permissions, auto-approve risks
- **MCP server**: Hardcoded secrets, shell injection, typosquatting
- **Stack-specific**: Prototype pollution (Node.js), Express, React, Go

```bash
# CLI — scan changed files only (great for CI)
harness check-security --changed-only

# CLI — full project scan
harness check-security
```

#### Deep Security Review

```
/harness:code-review --deep
```

Adds OWASP/CWE-focused threat modeling to the standard code review pipeline using the **security-reviewer** persona.

---

### 5. Validating Coverage Quality (Mutation Testing)

Code coverage percentages lie. 80% line coverage doesn't mean your tests catch 80% of bugs. Mutation testing tells you the truth.

```bash
harness skill run harness-mutation-test
```

How it works:

1. **CONFIGURE** — Sets up Stryker (JS/TS), mutmut (Python), PIT (Java), or cargo-mutants (Rust)
2. **GENERATE** — Creates code mutations (flip conditionals, change operators, remove calls)
3. **EXECUTE** — Runs your test suite against each mutation
4. **ANALYZE** — Reports which mutations survived (your tests didn't catch them)

**Recommended thresholds:**

- 80% mutation score for business-critical modules (payment, auth, data processing)
- 60% for general application code
- No threshold for infrastructure/glue code

**When to use:**

- After reaching 60%+ line coverage (below that, write more tests first)
- On critical business logic where bugs have high impact
- Before major releases

---

### 6. Performance and Load Testing

```bash
harness skill run harness-load-testing
```

Supports **k6**, **Artillery**, **Gatling**, and **JMeter**. Walks you through:

1. **DETECT** — Finds existing load tests, maps critical endpoints
2. **DESIGN** — Creates test scenarios:
   - **Smoke**: 1-5 VUs, 1 min — validates scripts work
   - **Load**: Expected traffic, 5-15 min — validates normal operation
   - **Stress**: 2-3x traffic — finds the breaking point
   - **Spike**: 10x burst — tests auto-scaling
   - **Soak**: Expected traffic, 1-4 hours — finds memory leaks
3. **EXECUTE** — Runs tests with monitoring
4. **ANALYZE** — Compares results against thresholds (p95, p99, error rate, throughput)

For **structural performance checks** in CI:

```bash
harness check-perf              # Full check (complexity + coupling + size budgets)
harness check-perf --structural # Complexity thresholds only
harness check-perf --coupling   # Coupling metrics only
```

---

### 7. Visual Regression Testing

```bash
harness skill run harness-visual-regression
```

Catches unintended CSS regressions, layout shifts, and rendering inconsistencies:

1. **DETECT** — Finds existing visual test infrastructure (Storybook, Chromatic, Percy, Playwright screenshots)
2. **BASELINE** — Captures reference screenshots across a viewport/theme matrix (mobile, tablet, desktop; light, dark)
3. **COMPARE** — Runs pixel-level diffs against baselines
4. **CLASSIFY** — Distinguishes intentional changes, regressions, and environmental noise

Works with Storybook + Chromatic, Playwright screenshots, Jest + jest-image-snapshot, and Cypress + Percy.

---

### 8. End-to-End Testing

```bash
harness skill run harness-e2e
```

Full browser testing with Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium:

1. **DETECT** — Identifies framework, catalogs existing E2E tests, maps application entry points
2. **SCAFFOLD** — Generates page objects with stable selectors (`data-testid`, `role`, `aria-label`), shared fixtures, auth helpers
3. **IMPLEMENT** — Writes tests prioritized by business impact:
   - Smoke tests (app loads, critical pages render)
   - Auth flows (login, logout, session persistence)
   - Primary business flows (the 80% user value)
   - Error paths (validation, 404, permission denied)
4. **VALIDATE** — Runs suite, detects flakiness, and **systematically remediates** flaky tests

**Best practices enforced:**

- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- No arbitrary timeouts — explicit waits only
- Test isolation (no shared mutable state)
- Tags: `@smoke`, `@critical-path`, `@slow`

---

### 9. Integration and Contract Testing

```bash
harness skill run harness-integration-test
```

For testing service boundaries without full E2E infrastructure:

1. **DISCOVER** — Maps API routes, service dependencies, shared resources
2. **MOCK** — Sets up Testcontainers, in-memory DBs, or transaction rollback strategies
3. **IMPLEMENT** — API tests, consumer-driven contracts (Pact), repository tests
4. **VALIDATE** — Verifies contracts, error scenarios, timeout handling

Great for microservices, event-driven architectures, and API-first development.

---

### 10. Verifying a Feature Is Complete

When a developer says "it's done," verify mechanically:

```
/harness:verification
```

This checks at **3 tiers**:

| Tier            | What It Checks                             | Example                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **EXISTS**      | Does the file exist with real content?     | `src/services/auth.ts — exists, 45 lines`                          |
| **SUBSTANTIVE** | Is it a real implementation, not a stub?   | `src/api/routes.ts — line 42: empty catch block (stub)`            |
| **WIRED**       | Is it connected to the rest of the system? | `DELETE /bookmarks/:id route defined but not registered in app.ts` |

The **WIRED** tier catches things tests might miss — a route that exists but isn't reachable because it's not registered in the router.

For the deepest check (verification + AI review):

```
/harness:integrity
```

---

## CI/CD Integration for QA Gates

### The All-in-One CI Check

```bash
harness ci check --json
```

Runs 9 checks in sequence:

| Check          | What It Validates                                 | Blocks Merge?          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `validate`     | AGENTS.md structure, file integrity               | Yes (error)            |
| `deps`         | Layer dependency boundaries, no forbidden imports | Yes (error)            |
| `docs`         | Documentation coverage meets threshold            | Configurable (warning) |
| `entropy`      | Code drift, dead code detection                   | Configurable (warning) |
| `security`     | Secrets, injection, XSS, weak crypto              | Yes (error)            |
| `perf`         | Complexity thresholds, coupling, size budgets     | Configurable (warning) |
| `phase-gate`   | Spec-to-implementation mapping                    | Configurable           |
| `arch`         | Architecture constraints, baselines               | Yes (error)            |
| `traceability` | Requirement-to-code mapping                       | Configurable (warning) |

### GitHub Actions Setup

```bash
harness ci init --platform github
```

Generates a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that:

- Runs checks on push to main and on pull requests
- Posts a summary comment on the PR
- Labels the PR on failure

### Customizing

```bash
# Fail on warnings too (stricter)
harness ci check --fail-on warning

# Skip checks that aren't relevant yet
harness ci check --skip entropy,phase-gate

# Scan only changed files for security (faster)
harness check-security --changed-only
```

### JSON Output for Reporting

```bash

## The Knowledge Graph: Your QA Superpower

The knowledge graph is a structural model of your codebase — 30 node types, 25 edge types — that powers many of harness's QA features.

### Build It

```bash
harness scan
```

### What It Enables for QA

| Capability                   | How to Use It                        | QA Value                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Test selection**           | `/harness:test-advisor`              | Run only the tests that matter for a change                                |
| **Impact analysis**          | `/harness:impact-analysis`           | "If I change this file, what could break?"                                 |
| **Blast radius**             | `compute_blast_radius` (MCP tool)    | Probabilistic cascading failure simulation                                 |
| **Conflict prediction**      | `predict_conflicts` (MCP tool)       | Predict merge conflicts before parallel work starts                        |
| **Anomaly detection**        | `detect_anomalies` (MCP tool)        | Find structural outliers via z-score analysis                              |
| **Coverage gaps**            | Test advisor's coverage gap flagging | Identify changed files with no test coverage                               |
| **Hotspot detection**        | `/harness:hotspot-detector`          | Find files that change frequently and have high coupling (high-risk areas) |
| **Natural language queries** | `ask_graph` (MCP tool)               | "What depends on the auth module?" "What tests cover the payment service?" |

### Example: Risk-Based Testing

```
1. Run /harness:hotspot-detector to find high-churn, high-coupling files
2. Run /harness:test-advisor on those files to see test coverage
3. Focus your testing effort on the intersection: high-risk areas with weak coverage
```

## Improving Your QA Processes Over Time

### Week 1: Foundation

- Install harness CLI and run `harness setup`
- Run `/harness:verify` on your project to see where you stand
- Run `harness scan` to build the knowledge graph
- Start using `/harness:test-advisor` before pushing changes
- Add `harness ci check` to your CI pipeline

### Week 2: Review Process

- Start using `/harness:code-review` for PR reviews
- Configure review rigor levels (`--fast` for low-risk, `--thorough` for high-risk)
- Use `/harness:verification` to validate feature completeness
- Run `/harness:security-scan` on the full codebase to establish a baseline

### Week 3: Test Intelligence

- Use `/harness:hotspot-detector` to identify high-risk areas
- Run `harness skill run harness-mutation-test` on critical business modules
- Analyze mutation results to find where tests are weakest
- Write targeted tests for survived mutants

### Week 4: Advanced Workflows

- Set up `harness skill run harness-e2e` for critical user flows
- Configure `harness skill run harness-visual-regression` for UI components
- Use `harness skill run harness-load-testing` to establish performance baselines
- Enable `harness check-perf` in CI with structural budgets

### Ongoing: Continuous Improvement

- Run `/harness:detect-doc-drift` weekly to keep docs accurate
- Use `/harness:cleanup-dead-code` monthly to reduce noise
- Monitor hotspots — areas that keep churning need structural fixes, not more tests
- Review mutation scores quarterly on critical modules
- Use `/harness:impact-analysis` before any large refactor

## FAQ

### Do I need to be a developer to use harness?

No. The slash commands work in plain English through your AI coding tool. You describe what you want ("review this PR", "which tests should I run?", "check for security issues") and the skill handles the technical execution. The CLI commands are also straightforward for CI integration.

### Does harness replace our existing test framework?

No. Harness **orchestrates** your existing tools. It wraps Vitest, Jest, Playwright, Cypress, k6, Stryker, and others — it doesn't replace them. Your tests, your frameworks, your CI — harness adds intelligence and enforcement on top.

### How does the test advisor work without a knowledge graph?

It falls back to three strategies: filename convention matching (`auth.ts` → `auth.test.ts`), import parsing (grep for imports in test files), and git co-change analysis (files that change in the same commits). This catches ~80% of what the graph catches. Run `harness scan` to get the full 100%.

### Can I use harness with any programming language?

The core validation and CLI work with any language. Testing skills have specific framework support:

- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Full support (Vitest, Jest, Playwright, Cypress, Stryker, k6, fast-check)
- **Python**: mutmut, hypothesis, pytest, Artillery
- **Java/Kotlin**: PIT, JUnit, Gatling, Spring Cloud Contract
- **Go, Rust, C#**: Supported with language-specific tooling

### How does harness compare to SonarQube / CodeClimate?

Those tools analyze code quality statically. Harness does that **plus**:

- Graph-based test intelligence (which tests to run, impact analysis)
- AI-powered code review with parallel agents
- Mutation testing orchestration
- Architectural constraint enforcement (layer boundaries, forbidden imports)
- Spec-to-implementation traceability
- Real-time agent feedback during development

### What if the security scan produces false positives?

Configure exclusions in `harness.config.json`:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "exclude": ["tests/**", "scripts/**"],
    "severityThreshold": "warning"
  }
}
```

### How do I integrate harness checks into my existing CI?

```bash
npm install -g @harness-engineering/cli
harness ci check --json
```

That's it. The exit code (0/1/2) integrates with any CI platform. Use `harness ci init --platform github|gitlab|generic` to generate a ready-to-commit config file.

## Summary

Harness Engineering gives QA engineers a **force multiplier**. Instead of manually reviewing every PR, guessing which tests to run, and hoping coverage numbers mean something:

1. **Let the graph tell you what to test** — `/harness:test-advisor` eliminates guesswork
2. **Automate your review process** — `/harness:code-review` catches bugs, security issues, and architectural violations in a structured pipeline
3. **Verify, don't trust** — `/harness:verification` mechanically checks that features are actually complete (EXISTS → SUBSTANTIVE → WIRED)
4. **Validate test quality** — `harness-mutation-test` skill proves your tests catch real bugs, not just execute lines
5. **Gate your pipeline** — `harness ci check` runs 9 quality checks before any merge
6. **Focus effort where it matters** — Hotspot detection + impact analysis tells you where bugs are most likely to hide

The goal isn't to do more QA work. It's to do the **right** QA work, faster, with higher confidence.
