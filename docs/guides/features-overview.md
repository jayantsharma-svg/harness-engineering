# What Can Harness Do?

Harness Engineering is a toolkit that makes AI coding agents reliable through mechanical enforcement. Instead of hoping agents follow conventions, harness validates their output at every step.

This page maps every major capability to the command, skill, or tool that provides it. Use it as a starting point — each section links to detailed docs.
